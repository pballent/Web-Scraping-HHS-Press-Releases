This is the first time since the launch of the new Conscience and Religious Freedom Division a year ago that OCR has found a violation under these laws. This matter arose from complaints filed by Sacramento Life Center LivingWell Medical Clinic Pregnancy Center of the North Coast and Confidence Pregnancy Center alleging that California subjected them to potential fines and discrimination for refusing to post notices referring for abortion.</p> <p>California adopted the Reproductive Freedom Accountability Comprehensive Care and Transparency Act (the \u201cFACT Act\u201d) on October 9 2015 which required pregnancy resource centers that met the FACT Act\u2019s definition of \u201clicensed covered facilities\u201d to post notices stating that California provides free or low-cost family planning services and abortion. The FACT Act also required pregnancy resource centers that constituted \u201cunlicensed covered facilities\u201d under the Act to post notices in advertisements and communications. A violation of the FACT Act threatened civil fines of $500 for a first offense and $1000 for each subsequent offense.</p> <p>The Weldon and Coats-Snowe Amendments prohibit state and local governments that receive certain federal funds from subjecting health care entities to discrimination on the basis that the health care entity does not perform or refer for abortions.</p> <p>On June 26 2018 the U.S. Supreme Court decided <em>National Institute of Family and Life Advocates v. Becerra</em> (\u201c<em>NIFLA</em>\u201d) finding that the FACT Act likely violated the First Amendment rights of pregnancy resource centers by impermissibly compelling speech. In concurrence Justice Kennedy stated that \u201cviewpoint discrimination is inherent in the design and structure of [the] Act\u201d and that California required \u201cprimarily pro-life pregnancy centers to promote the State\u2019s own preferred message advertising abortions.\u201d</p> <p>OCR\u2019s Conscience and Religious Freedom Division established last year conducted an independent investigation and determined that the FACT Act violated the Weldon and Coats-Snowe Amendments by requiring \u201clicensed covered facilities\u201d to refer for abortion and violated the Weldon amendment by subjecting \u201cunlicensed covered facilities\u201d to discrimination by targeting them for burdensome and unnecessary notice requirements because they do not refer for or make arrangements for abortion.</p> <p>Following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>NIFLA</em> a federal district court enjoined California from enforcing the FACT Act against any pregnancy resource center in the state. OCR is issuing its finding of violation for California\u2019s unlawful discrimination and as a result of the permanent injunction is closing the complaint as favorably resolved for the complainants and all similarly situated parties. If California were to violate the terms of the injunction it would be subject to a reopening of the complaints and further enforcement action by OCR.</p> <p>Roger Severino director of OCR stated \u201cWe are pleased that the Supreme Court blocked California\u2019s blatant discrimination against non-profits that give life-affirming options to women facing unplanned pregnancies. Our violation finding underscores not only that California must follow the Constitution but that it also must respect federal conscience protection laws when it accepts federal funds.\u201d</p> <p>View the <a data-vars-internal-link=""/file/17194"" href=""/sites/default/files/california-notice-of-violation.pdf"">California Notice of Violation</a></p> <p>Enter your email:</p> <p>Receive latest updates</p> <p><a href=""/rss/news.xml""><img alt=""Subscribe to our RSS"" class=""rss-updates"" src=""/sites/all/themes/project_h/css/images/rss-button.png""/></a></p> <p><a href=""/about/news/contacts/index.html#media-info"">HHS Media Information</a><br/><a href=""/about/news/contacts/index.html#aspa-press-contact"">ASPA Press Contacts</a><br/><a href=""/about/news/contacts/index.html#agency-press-contact"">HHS Agency Press Contacts</a></p> <p><strong><a class=""view-all"" href=""/about/news/contacts/index.html"">View all</a></strong></p> <p>\n<a addthis:userid=""HHS"" alt=""Visit the HHS Facebook account"" class=""addthis_button_facebook_follow"" target=""_parent"" title=""Visit the HHS Facebook account""><img alt=""Visit the HHS Facebook account"" src=""/sites/all/themes/project_h/css/images/facebook-icon-32x32.png""/></a>\n<a href=""https://twitter.com/hhsgov"" target=""_parent"" title=""Visit the HHS Twitter account""><img alt=""Visit the HHS Twitter account"" src=""/sites/all/themes/project_h/css/images/twitter-icon-32x32.png""/></a>\n<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/hhsgov/"" target=""_parent"" title=""Visit the HHS Instagram account""><img alt=""Visit the HHS Instagram account"" src=""/sites/all/themes/project_h/css/images/instagram-icon-32x32.png""/></a>\n</p> <p>\n<a addthis:userid=""USGOVHHS"" alt=""Visit the HHS YouTube account"" class=""addthis_button_youtube_follow"" target=""_parent"" title=""Visit the HHS YouTube account""><img alt=""Visit the HHS YouTube account"" src=""/sites/all/themes/project_h/css/images/youtube-icon-32x32.png""/></a>\n<a addthis:userid=""hhsgov/"" alt=""Visit the HHS Flickr account"" class=""addthis_button_flickr_follow"" target=""_parent"" title=""Visit the HHS Flickr account""><img alt=""Visit the HHS Flickr account"" src=""/sites/all/themes/project_h/css/images/flickr-icon-32x32.png""/></a>\n<a addthis:userid=""us-department-of-health-and-human-services/"" addthis:usertype=""company"" alt=""Visit the HHS LinkedIn account"" class=""addthis_button_linkedin_follow"" target=""_parent"" title=""Visit the HHS LinkedIn account""><img alt=""Visit the HHS LinkedIn account"" src=""/sites/all/themes/project_h/css/images/linkedin-icon-32x32.png""/></a>\n<!-- <a class=""addthis_button_pinterest_follow"" addthis:userid=""hhsgov/"" title=""Visit the HHS Pinterest account"" alt=""Visit the HHS Pinterest account"" target=""_parent""><img src=""/sites/all/themes/project_h/css/images/footer-pinterest.png"" alt=""Visit the HHS Pinterest account"" /></a> -->\n<!-- <a href=""https://plus.google.com/+HHS/posts"" title=""Visit HHS GooglePlus account"" target=""_parent""><img src=""/sites/all/themes/project_h/css/images/footer-googleplus.png"" alt=""Visit HHS GooglePlus account"" /></a> -->\n</p> <p>To sign up for updates or to access your subscriber preferences please enter your contact information below.</p> <p>U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services<br/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t200 Independence Avenue S.W.<br/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWashington D.C. 20201<br/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tToll Free Call Center: 1-877-696-6775\u200b</p>]",[Home &gt; About &gt; News &gt; OCR Finds the State of California Violated Federal Law in Discriminating Against Pregnancy Resource Centers Today the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced that it found that the State of California violated the federal conscience protection laws known as the Weldon and Coats-Snowe Amendments.

A value-based healthcare system will help deliver each patient the right care at the right price in the right setting from the right provider.\u201d</p> <p>The new model the Emergency Triage Treat and Transport (ET3) model will make it possible for participating ambulance suppliers and providers to partner with qualified health care practitioners to deliver treatment in place (either on-the-scene or through telehealth) and with alternative destination sites (such as primary care doctors\u2019 offices or urgent-care clinics) to provide care for Medicare beneficiaries following a medical emergency for which they have accessed 911 services. In doing so the model seeks to engage health care providers across the care continuum to more appropriately and effectively meet beneficiaries\u2019 needs. Additionally the model will encourage development of medical triage lines for low-acuity 911 calls in regions where participating ambulance suppliers and providers operate. The ET3 model will have a five-year performance period with an anticipated start date in early 2020.</p> <p>\u201cThe ET3 model is yet another way CMS is transforming America\u2019s healthcare system to deliver better value and results for patients through innovation\u201d said CMS Administrator Seema Verma. \u201cThis model will help make how we pay for care more patient-centric by supporting care in more appropriate settings while saving emergency medical services providers precious time and resources to respond to more serious cases.\u201d</p> <p>Currently Medicare primarily pays for unscheduled emergency ground ambulance services when beneficiaries are transported to a hospital emergency department (ED) creating an incentive to transport all beneficiaries to the hospital even when an alternative treatment option may be more appropriate. To counter this incentive the ET3 model will test two new ambulance payments while continuing to pay for emergency transport for a Medicare beneficiary to a hospital ED or other destination covered under current regulations:</p> <p>The ET3 model encourages high-quality provision of care by enabling participating ambulance suppliers and providers to earn up to a 5% payment adjustment in later years of the model based on their achievement of key quality measures. The quality measurement strategy will aim to avoid adding more burden to participants including minimizing any new reporting requirements. Qualified health care practitioners or alternative destination sites that partner with participating ambulance suppliers and providers would receive payment as usual under Medicare for any services rendered.</p> <p>The model will use a phased approach through multiple application rounds to maximize participation in regions across the country. In an effort to ensure access to model interventions across all individuals in a region CMS will encourage ET3 model participants to partner with other payers including state Medicaid agencies.</p> <p>CMS anticipates releasing a Request for Applications in Summer 2019 to solicit Medicare-enrolled ambulance suppliers and providers. In Fall 2019 to implement the triage lines for low-acuity 911 calls CMS anticipates issuing a Notice of Funding Opportunity for a limited number of two-year cooperative agreements available to local governments their designees or other entities that operate or have authority over one or more 911 dispatches in geographic locations where ambulance suppliers and providers have been selected to participate.</p> <p>For more information please visit: <a data-vars-outbound-link=""https://innovation.cms.gov/initiatives/et3/"" href=""https://innovation.cms.gov/initiatives/et3/"">https://innovation.cms.gov/initiatives/et3/</a>.</p> <p>Enter your email:</p> <p>Receive latest updates</p> <p><a href=""/rss/news.xml""><img alt=""Subscribe to our RSS"" class=""rss-updates"" src=""/sites/all/themes/project_h/css/images/rss-button.png""/></a></p> <p><a href=""/about/news/contacts/index.html#media-info"">HHS Media Information</a><br/><a href=""/about/news/contacts/index.html#aspa-press-contact"">ASPA Press Contacts</a><br/><a href=""/about/news/contacts/index.html#agency-press-contact"">HHS Agency Press Contacts</a></p> <p><strong><a class=""view-all"" href=""/about/news/contacts/index.html"">View all</a></strong></p> <p>\n<a addthis:userid=""HHS"" alt=""Visit the HHS Facebook account"" class=""addthis_button_facebook_follow"" target=""_parent"" title=""Visit the HHS Facebook account""><img alt=""Visit the HHS Facebook account"" src=""/sites/all/themes/project_h/css/images/facebook-icon-32x32.png""/></a>\n<a href=""https://twitter.com/hhsgov"" target=""_parent"" title=""Visit the HHS Twitter account""><img alt=""Visit the HHS Twitter account"" src=""/sites/all/themes/project_h/css/images/twitter-icon-32x32.png""/></a>\n<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/hhsgov/"" target=""_parent"" title=""Visit the HHS Instagram account""><img alt=""Visit the HHS Instagram account"" src=""/sites/all/themes/project_h/css/images/instagram-icon-32x32.png""/></a>\n</p> <p>\n<a addthis:userid=""USGOVHHS"" alt=""Visit the HHS YouTube account"" class=""addthis_button_youtube_follow"" target=""_parent"" title=""Visit the HHS YouTube account""><img alt=""Visit the HHS YouTube account"" src=""/sites/all/themes/project_h/css/images/youtube-icon-32x32.png""/></a>\n<a addthis:userid=""hhsgov/"" alt=""Visit the HHS Flickr account"" class=""addthis_button_flickr_follow"" target=""_parent"" title=""Visit the HHS Flickr account""><img alt=""Visit the HHS Flickr account"" src=""/sites/all/themes/project_h/css/images/flickr-icon-32x32.png""/></a>\n<a addthis:userid=""us-department-of-health-and-human-services/"" addthis:usertype=""company"" alt=""Visit the HHS LinkedIn account"" class=""addthis_button_linkedin_follow"" target=""_parent"" title=""Visit the HHS LinkedIn account""><img alt=""Visit the HHS LinkedIn account"" src=""/sites/all/themes/project_h/css/images/linkedin-icon-32x32.png""/></a>\n<!-- <a class=""addthis_button_pinterest_follow"" addthis:userid=""hhsgov/"" title=""Visit the HHS Pinterest account"" alt=""Visit the HHS Pinterest account"" target=""_parent""><img src=""/sites/all/themes/project_h/css/images/footer-pinterest.png"" alt=""Visit the HHS Pinterest account"" /></a> -->\n<!-- <a href=""https://plus.google.com/+HHS/posts"" title=""Visit HHS GooglePlus account"" target=""_parent""><img src=""/sites/all/themes/project_h/css/images/footer-googleplus.png"" alt=""Visit HHS GooglePlus account"" /></a> -->\n</p> <p>To sign up for updates or to access your subscriber preferences please enter your contact information below.</p> <p>U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services<br/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t200 Independence Avenue S.W.<br/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWashington D.C. 20201<br/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tToll Free Call Center: 1-877-696-6775\u200b</p>]",[Home &gt; About &gt; News &gt; HHS launches innovative payment model with new treatment and transport options to more appropriately and effectively meet beneficiaries\u2019 emergency needs Today the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (Innovation Center) which tests innovative payment and service delivery models to lower costs and improve the quality of care announced a new payment model for emergency ambulance services that aims to allow Medicare Fee-For-Service (FFS) beneficiaries to receive the most appropriate level of care at the right time and place with the potential for lower out-of-pocket costs. \u201cThis model will create a new set of incentives for emergency transport and care ensuring patients get convenient appropriate treatment in whatever setting makes sense for them\u201d said HHS Secretary Alex Azar. \u201cToday\u2019s announcement shows that we can radically rethink the incentives around care delivery even in one of the trickiest parts of our system.

I can personally testify to how important they are: As a parent I ensured that all my kids were vaccinated according to the childhood schedule and I recently received a recommended vaccine to prepare for some international travel.</p> <p>\u201cWe have come a long way in fighting infectious diseases in America but we risk backsliding and seeing our families neighbors and communities needlessly suffer from preventable diseases. This National Infant Immunization Week all Americans should check to make sure that they and their loved ones are up to date with the CDC's recommended vaccine schedule which provides guidelines for Americans of all ages and with specific health conditions. Especially if you have an infant talk to your doctor about what vaccines are recommended. It\u2019s one of the easiest ways to keep you your family and your community healthy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAs CDC Director and as a physician I have and continue to wholeheartedly advocate for infant immunization.\xa0 More importantly as a father and grandfather I have ensured all of my children and grandchildren are vaccinated on the recommended schedule. Vaccines are safe. Vaccines do not cause autism. Vaccine-preventable diseases are dangerous.</p> <p>\u201cMore than 94% of parents vaccinate their children to protect them from the harmful effects of measles and other vaccine- preventable diseases. CDC is working to reach the small percentage of vaccine-hesitant individuals so they too understand the importance of vaccines. It is imperative that we correct misinformation and reassure fearful parents so they protect their children from illnesses with long-lasting health impacts.\xa0 Roughly 1.3 percent or 100000 children in this country under the age of two have not been vaccinated making them vulnerable to the current measles outbreak.</p> <p>\u201cI call upon healthcare providers to encourage parents and expectant parents to vaccinate their children for their own protection and to avoid the spread of vaccine-preventable diseases within their families and communities.\xa0 We must join together as a Nation to once again eliminate measles and prevent future disease outbreaks.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAs we head into National Infant Immunization week I want to take the opportunity to underscore the public health importance of immunizations. One of my priorities at FDA is to continue to support the agency\u2019s efforts to reinforce the rigorous and robust process we use to ensure the safety and effectiveness of vaccines that prevent infectious diseases like influenza and measles.</p> <p>""I\u2019m horrified by the current outbreaks of measles \u2013 a disease we thought we had eliminated in the United States in 2000. With a vaccine that is highly effective this life-threatening infection is now making a tragic comeback in part because of vaccine avoidance. And unfortunately measles is not the only disease that is threatening to make a resurgence. The best way to prevent such diseases is to vaccinate against them. I want to reassure the American public that these vaccines have been determined to be safe and effective and dispel the continued misconception that they are associated with the development of autism. We remain dedicated to continuing our important work alongside our federal state and local partners to monitor the safety and effectiveness of our current vaccines encourage vaccinations against preventable diseases and support the development of novel vaccines to address emerging threats to public health.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAs a pediatric critical care physician who has treated critically ill children suffering from vaccine preventable diseases I know first-hand the devastation to the child \u2013 and to the family and community \u2013 of a death or severe brain damage that could have been avoided by a simple vaccination.\xa0 The cornerstone of public health vaccination makes these dreaded diseases preventable. I want you to know that vaccines are highly effective and safe with most serious side effects being exceptionally rare \u2013 and much less serious than contracting the actual disease.</p> <p>\u201cThe U.S. government is committed to protecting the health safety and security of the American public. We must continue to put science into action wherever and whenever we have the tools to confront and eliminate diseases. This includes increasing vaccination rates for both routine immunizations and seasonal influenza continuing federally supported vaccination programs and educating parents grandparents patients and healthcare providers on the importance safety and effectiveness of vaccines.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cVaccinations save lives protect our children and are one of the greatest public health achievements in U.S. history. Most parents choose to protect their children with these safe proven vaccines. However because some parents delayed or refused vaccination for their children we are now seeing a large very concerning outbreak of measles.</p> <p>\u201cYoung children are at increased risk for infections because their immune systems have not yet matured. Vaccinating your baby according to the recommended immunization schedule provides the best protection against 14 serious childhood illnesses\u2014including measles and whooping cough\u2014before your child is 2 years old.</p> <p>\u201cAs a parent I have publicly talked about my family\u2019s decision to protect my three children by getting them vaccinated. Unfortunately there is inaccurate information circulating about vaccines so let\u2019s make sure we separate the facts from the myths. If you have any concerns or questions talk to your child\u2019s health care provider.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cVaccines are essential for protecting children against infectious diseases such as measles mumps rubella and whooping cough. \xa0Many of these diseases are largely forgotten in our country. \xa0Before vaccines became available however these diseases exacted a huge toll. \xa0For example before the measles vaccine was licensed in 1963 the virus infected at least 2 million Americans a year causing 500 deaths and 48000 hospitalizations.\xa0</p> <p>\u201cIt may be upsetting for parents to see their babies or young children receive several vaccinations during a medical visit. However these shots are necessary for protection from multiple dangerous\u2014and sometimes deadly\u2014diseases. Vaccinations typically cause only mild side effects such as redness or swelling at the injection site; serious side effects are very rare. The public health benefits of vaccination far outweigh the possible side effects.</p> <p>\u201cWhen children are vaccinated their immune systems develop infection-fighting antibodies to protect them from contracting the targeted disease if they are exposed to it later in life. The full course of recommended childhood vaccinations largely completed for most children by age 6 not only protects the vaccinated child but also contributes to a larger umbrella of protection known as \u201cherd immunity.\u201d By doing so it helps prevent the spread of disease to those who cannot be vaccinated including newborns who are too young to be vaccinated and people with compromised immune systems who cannot effectively develop antibodies to fend off disease.</p> <p>\u201cMany diseases against which children in the United States are immunized are rare in this country because of mass vaccination programs. However these diseases are still found in other parts of the world and can be reintroduced into the United States by travelers and then spread within our communities among people who have not been vaccinated.\xa0The current resurgence of measles a highly contagious and potentially deadly disease that was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000 is a painful reminder of the need for vaccination.\xa0 \xa0</p> <p>\u201cParents and caregivers please vaccinate your children to protect them as well as friends family and community members who cannot be vaccinated.\u201d\xa0\xa0</p> <p>Enter your email:</p> <p>Receive latest updates</p> <p><a href=""/rss/news.xml""><img alt=""Subscribe to our RSS"" class=""rss-updates"" src=""/sites/all/themes/project_h/css/images/rss-button.png""/></a></p> <p><a href=""/about/news/contacts/index.html#media-info"">HHS Media Information</a><br/><a href=""/about/news/contacts/index.html#aspa-press-contact"">ASPA Press Contacts</a><br/><a href=""/about/news/contacts/index.html#agency-press-contact"">HHS Agency Press Contacts</a></p> <p><strong><a class=""view-all"" href=""/about/news/contacts/index.html"">View all</a></strong></p> <p>\n<a addthis:userid=""HHS"" alt=""Visit the HHS Facebook account"" class=""addthis_button_facebook_follow"" target=""_parent"" title=""Visit the HHS Facebook account""><img alt=""Visit the HHS Facebook account"" src=""/sites/all/themes/project_h/css/images/facebook-icon-32x32.png""/></a>\n<a href=""https://twitter.com/hhsgov"" target=""_parent"" title=""Visit the HHS Twitter account""><img alt=""Visit the HHS Twitter account"" src=""/sites/all/themes/project_h/css/images/twitter-icon-32x32.png""/></a>\n<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/hhsgov/"" target=""_parent"" title=""Visit the HHS Instagram account""><img alt=""Visit the HHS Instagram account"" src=""/sites/all/themes/project_h/css/images/instagram-icon-32x32.png""/></a>\n</p> <p>\n<a addthis:userid=""USGOVHHS"" alt=""Visit the HHS YouTube account"" class=""addthis_button_youtube_follow"" target=""_parent"" title=""Visit the HHS YouTube account""><img alt=""Visit the HHS YouTube account"" src=""/sites/all/themes/project_h/css/images/youtube-icon-32x32.png""/></a>\n<a addthis:userid=""hhsgov/"" alt=""Visit the HHS Flickr account"" class=""addthis_button_flickr_follow"" target=""_parent"" title=""Visit the HHS Flickr account""><img alt=""Visit the HHS Flickr account"" src=""/sites/all/themes/project_h/css/images/flickr-icon-32x32.png""/></a>\n<a addthis:userid=""us-department-of-health-and-human-services/"" addthis:usertype=""company"" alt=""Visit the HHS LinkedIn account"" class=""addthis_button_linkedin_follow"" target=""_parent"" title=""Visit the HHS LinkedIn account""><img alt=""Visit the HHS LinkedIn account"" src=""/sites/all/themes/project_h/css/images/linkedin-icon-32x32.png""/></a>\n<!-- <a class=""addthis_button_pinterest_follow"" addthis:userid=""hhsgov/"" title=""Visit the HHS Pinterest account"" alt=""Visit the HHS Pinterest account"" target=""_parent""><img src=""/sites/all/themes/project_h/css/images/footer-pinterest.png"" alt=""Visit the HHS Pinterest account"" /></a> -->\n<!-- <a href=""https://plus.google.com/+HHS/posts"" title=""Visit HHS GooglePlus account"" target=""_parent""><img src=""/sites/all/themes/project_h/css/images/footer-googleplus.png"" alt=""Visit HHS GooglePlus account"" /></a> -->\n</p> <p>To sign up for updates or to access your subscriber preferences please enter your contact information below.</p> <p>U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services<br/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t200 Independence Avenue S.W.<br/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWashington D.C. 20201<br/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tToll Free Call Center: 1-877-696-6775\u200b</p>]","[Home &gt; About &gt; News &gt; HHS Officials Highlight Safety and Effectiveness of Vaccines and National Infant Immunization Week \u201cThis week is National Infant Immunization Week which is an opportunity to celebrate lifesaving vaccines that protect our children. \u201cUnfortunately because we are seeing significant outbreaks of measles across the country it is also a more important opportunity than ever to remind Americans: Vaccinations are safe and have been proven time and again to be effective.

implemented to reduce the likelihood of future incidents of alleged discrimination.</p> <p>In January 2019 UNC Health Care agreed that the individual\u2019s medical records will be amended to clarify that they are eligible to be considered for placement on the UNOS transplant list.\xa0 OCR will provide technical assistance to UNC Health Care in the development of their transplant eligibility policy.</p> <p>\u201cEvery life is precious and no one should be blocked from access to an organ transplant because of stereotypes about persons with disabilities.\xa0 It is also against the

HHS and the American Society of Nephrology Award KidneyX Redesign Dialysis Phase 1 Winners The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of the Chief Technology Officer and the American Society of Nephrology have selected 15 winning teams for Phase 1 of the KidneyX Redesign Dialysis prize competition. Through a series of prize competitions offering cash awards and other incentives KidneyX aims to accelerate the development of innovative medical products and approaches that can significantly improve the way we prevent diagnose and treat kidney diseases. \u201cPrograms like KidneyX have the potential to improve the lives of millions of people and save billions of dollars in healthcare costs. I\u2019m impressed with the ambitious solutions proposed by the winning teams and grateful for the entrepreneurs working to reimagine dialysis\u201d said Ed Simcox Chief Technology Officer at HHS. \u201cSupporting innovation in this space is a critical step in helping people suffering from kidney diseases.\u201d Phase 1 challenged innovators across a wide range of fields to submit a short proposal on approaches that could enable the design of new artificial kidney devices extending life and improving quality of life. Of the 165 submissions received the submission topics ranged from innovations in vascular access and fluid filtration to innovations in hemodialysis and biosensors. The submissions were scored by 40+ technical reviewers comprised of patients and multi-disciplinary experts from government industry and academia. The top scoring submissions were then judged by a panel of nine experts in medicine biomedical science and engineering and commercialization. Fifteen winners were awarded monetary prizes of $75000 each. \u201cThe response to Phase 1 of the prize competition is proof positive of the strong eagerness for innovation and investment in new kidney care technologies and therapies\u201d said Dr. John Sedor Chair of the KidneyX Steering Committee. \u201cThe winning proposals address a broad range of potential improvements to dialysis and highlight the fact that there is more work to be done to change the status quo. Millions of patients are waiting.\u201d Phase 2 of Redesign Dialysis will start accepting submissions in fall 2019 and is open to all including Phase 1 winners. In Phase 2 innovators will be asked to develop and demonstrate functional and testable prototypes that can replicate some or all kidney functions. Up to three winners will be awarded $500000 each. The Phase 1 prize winners will be announced during the inaugural KidneyX Summit scheduled on April 29-30 2019 at the U.S. Institute of Peace in Washington D.C. Prize winners will present their solutions to an audience of industry leaders within government mechanical and bioengineering investment and medical product development. \u201cBuilding an artificial kidney is going to be a highly collaborative process and Redesign Dialysis is one step in building the community of innovators.

16,https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2019/05/24/hhs-proposes-to-revise-aca-section-1557-rule.html,"[<p class=""breadcrumb""><a href=""/"">Home</a> &gt; <a href=""/about"">About</a> &gt; <a href=""/about/news"">News</a> &gt; HHS Proposes to Revise ACA Section 1557 Rule to Enforce Civil Rights in Healthcare  Conform to Law and Eliminate Billions in Unnecessary Costs</p> <p>Today the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) proposed regulatory reform related to regulations issued under Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The proposed rule would maintain vigorous civil rights enforcement on the basis of race color national origin disability age and sex while revising certain provisions of the current Section 1557 rule that a federal court has said is likely unlawful. The proposal also would relieve the American people of approximately $3.6 billion in unnecessary regulatory costs over five years.</p> <p align=""center""><strong>Conforming to the Text of our Laws</strong></p> <p>In Section 1557 of the ACA Congress directed HHS to apply existing civil rights laws and regulations to healthcare and the ACA Exchanges including a 1972 law (Title IX) prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sex in certain federally funded programs. In 2016 HHS issued a new rule that redefined discrimination \u201con the basis of sex\u201d to include termination of pregnancy and gender identity which it defined as one\u2019s internal sense of being \u201cmale female neither or a combination of male and female.\u201d</p> <p>In response to a subsequent lawsuit by several states and healthcare entities on December 31 2016 a federal court preliminarily enjoined the rule\u2019s gender identity and termination of pregnancy provisions on a nationwide basis finding them contrary to the applicable civil rights law the Religious Freedom Restoration Act and the Administrative Procedure Act. A second federal court agreed. Because the preliminary injunction continues to be in effect HHS cannot and has not since the date of the injunction enforced the rule\u2019s provisions the court said are likely unlawful. The proposed rule would revise the provisions subject to those injunctions to conform with the plain understanding recognized by the court.</p> <p>\u201cWhen Congress prohibited sex discrimination it did so according to the plain meaning of the term and we are making our regulations conform\u201d said OCR Director Roger Severino. \u201cThe American people want vigorous protection of civil rights and faithfulness to the text of the laws passed by their representatives\u201d said Severino. \u201cThe proposed rule would accomplish both goals.\u201d</p> <p align=""center""><strong>Continued Robust Enforcement of Civil Rights Law</strong></p> <p>Under the proposed rule HHS would continue to vigorously enforce prohibitions of discrimination on the basis of race color national origin disability age and sex in healthcare as Section 1557 provides. The proposed rule would also retain protections under the 2016 regulation that ensure physical access for persons with disabilities to healthcare facilities and appropriate communication technology to assist persons who are visually or hearing-impaired. HHS\u2019s proposed rule would also retain protections for non-English speakers including the right to meaningful language access to healthcare qualification standards for translators and interpreters and limitations on the use of minors and family members as translators in healthcare settings. Regulated entities would also continue to be required to provide written assurance to the Department that they will comply with Section 1557\u2019s civil rights provisions and the proposed regulation.</p> <p>\u201cWe are committed to full enforcement of civil rights laws before during and after any rulemaking\u201d said Severino. \u201cWe are also committed to the elimination of regulations that contradict law or raise the costs of healthcare without achieving intended results.\u201d</p> <p align=""center""><strong>Removing Costly and Unnecessary Regulatory Burdens</strong></p> <p>The proposed revisions would eliminate $3.2 billion in unneeded paperwork burdens imposed by the 2016 rule. Covered entities report that the 2016 rule requires them to send billions of \u201ctagline\u201d notices each year informing patients and customers of their ability to have \u201csignificant documents\u201d translated in at least 15 languages. When HHS adopted the 2016 rule it projected notice and taglines costs of about $7.2 million in the first five years. Because the 2016 rule did not fully account for printing and mailing costs associated with these notices and taglines it underestimated the burden of these requirements by over three billion dollars over five years. Instead of requiring regulated health companies to mail billions of paper taglines to mostly English speakers the money saved could be used to more effectively address individual needs of non-English speakers such as by providing increased access for translators and interpreters.</p> <p>The proposed Section 1557 rule estimates an additional savings of approximately $400 million over five years by eliminating duplicative requirements and reverting to well-established language access guidance resulting in a total savings of approximately $3.6 billion in the first five years after finalization.</p> <p>\u201cAs a child of Hispanic immigrants I know how vitally important it is that people receive quality healthcare services regardless of the language they speak and this proposal grants providers the needed flexibility for achieving that goal\u201d said Severino. \u201cThe American people are tired of unnecessary regulations getting in the way of access to affordable healthcare and today\u2019s proposal would remove $3.6 billion in regulatory burdens that are ultimately being passed down to patients\u201d Severino concluded.</p> <p>Click to read the <a

Regulated entities would also continue to be required to provide written assurance to the Department that they will comply with Section 1557\u2019s civil rights provisions and the proposed regulation. \u201cWe are committed to full enforcement of civil rights laws before during and after any rulemaking\u201d said Severino. \u201cWe are also committed to the elimination of regulations that contradict law or raise the costs of healthcare without achieving intended results.\u201d Removing Costly and Unnecessary Regulatory Burdens The proposed revisions would eliminate $3.2 billion in unneeded paperwork burdens imposed by the 2016 rule. Covered entities report that the 2016 rule requires them to send billions of \u201ctagline\u201d notices each year informing patients and customers of their ability to have \u201csignificant documents\u201d translated in at least 15 languages. When HHS adopted the 2016 rule it projected notice and taglines costs of about $7.2 million in the first five years. Because the 2016 rule did not fully account for printing and mailing costs associated with these notices and taglines it underestimated the burden of these requirements by over three billion dollars over five years. Instead of requiring regulated health companies to mail billions of paper taglines to mostly English speakers the money saved could be used to more effectively address individual needs of non-English speakers such as by providing increased access for translators and interpreters. The proposed Section 1557 rule estimates an additional savings of approximately $400 million over five years by eliminating duplicative requirements and reverting to well-established language access guidance resulting in a total savings of approximately $3.6 billion in the first five years after finalization. \u201cAs a child of Hispanic immigrants I know how vitally important it is that people receive quality healthcare services regardless of the language they speak and this proposal grants providers the needed flexibility for achieving that goal\u201d said Severino. \u201cThe American people are tired of unnecessary regulations getting in the way of access to affordable healthcare and today\u2019s proposal would remove $3.6 billion in regulatory burdens that are ultimately being passed down to patients\u201d Severino concluded.

19,https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2019/02/11/hhs-proposes-new-rules-improve-interoperability-electronic-health-information.html,"[<p class=""breadcrumb""><a href=""/"">Home</a> &gt; <a href=""/about"">About</a> &gt; <a href=""/about/news"">News</a> &gt; HHS Proposes New Rules to Improve the Interoperability of Electronic Health Information</p> <p>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) today proposed new rules to support seamless and secure access exchange and use of electronic health information. The rules issued by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) and the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) would increase choice and competition while fostering innovation that promotes patient access to and control over their health information. The proposed ONC rule would require that patient electronic access to this electronic health information (EHI) be made available at no cost.</p> <p>\u201cThese proposed rules strive to bring the nation\u2019s healthcare system one step closer to a point where patients and clinicians have the access they need to all of a patient\u2019s health information helping them in making better choices about care and treatment\u201d said HHS Secretary Alex Azar. \u201cBy outlining specific requirements about electronic health information we will be able to help patients their caregivers and providers securely access and share health information. These steps forward for health IT are essential to building a healthcare system that pays for value rather than procedures especially through empowering patients as consumers.\u201d</p> <p>CMS\u2019 proposed changes to the healthcare delivery system support the MyHealthEData initiative and would increase the seamless flow of health information reduce burden on patients and providers and foster innovation by unleashing data for researchers and innovators. In 2018 CMS finalized regulations that use potential payment reductions for hospitals and clinicians to encourage providers to improve patient access to their electronic health information. For the first time CMS is now proposing requirements that Medicaid the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program Medicare Advantage plans and Qualified Health Plans in the Federally-facilitated Exchanges must provide enrollees with immediate electronic access to medical claims and other health information electronically by 2020.</p> <p>In support of patient-centered healthcare CMS would also require these health care providers and plans to implement open data sharing technologies to support transitions of care as patients move between these plan types. By ensuring patients have easy access to their information and that information follows them on their healthcare journey we can reduce burden and eliminate redundant procedures and testing thus giving clinicians the time to focus on improving care coordination and ultimately health outcomes.</p> <p>\u201cToday\u2019s announcement builds on CMS\u2019 efforts to create a more interoperable healthcare system which improves patient access seamless data exchange and enhanced care coordination\u201d said CMS Administrator Seema Verma.\xa0 \u201cBy requiring health insurers to share their information in an accessible format by 2020 125 million patients will have access to their health claims information electronically. This unprecedented step toward a healthcare future where patients are able to obtain and share their health data securely and privately with just a few clicks is just the beginning of a digital data revolution that truly empowers American patients.\u201d</p> <p>The CMS rule also proposes to publicly report providers or hospitals that participate in \u201cinformation blocking\u201d practices that unreasonably limit the availability disclosure and use of electronic health information undermine efforts to improve interoperability. \xa0Making this information publicly available may incentivize providers and clinicians to refrain from such practices.</p> <p>ONC\u2019s proposed rule promotes secure and more immediate access to health information for patients and their healthcare providers and new tools allowing for more choice in care and treatment. Specifically the proposed rule calls on the healthcare industry to adopt standardized application programming interfaces (APIs) which will help allow individuals to securely and easily access structured and unstructured EHI formats using smartphones and other mobile devices.\xa0It also implements the information blocking provisions of the 21<sup>st</sup> Century Cures Act including identifying reasonable and necessary activities that do not constitute information blocking.

HHS Proposes New Rules to Improve the Interoperability of Electronic Health Information The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) today proposed new rules to support seamless and secure access exchange and use of electronic health information. The rules issued by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) and the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) would increase choice and competition while fostering innovation that promotes patient access to and control over their health information. The proposed ONC rule would require that patient electronic access to this electronic health information (EHI) be made available at no cost. \u201cThese proposed rules strive to bring the nation\u2019s healthcare system one step closer to a point where patients and clinicians have the access they need to all of a patient\u2019s health information helping them in making better choices about care and treatment\u201d said HHS Secretary Alex Azar. \u201cBy outlining specific requirements about electronic health information we will be able to help patients their caregivers and providers securely access and share health information. These steps forward for health IT are essential to building a healthcare system that pays for value rather than procedures especially through empowering patients as consumers.\u201d CMS\u2019 proposed changes to the healthcare delivery system support the MyHealthEData initiative and would increase the seamless flow of health information reduce burden on patients and providers and foster innovation by unleashing data for researchers and innovators. In 2018 CMS finalized regulations that use potential payment reductions for hospitals and clinicians to encourage providers to improve patient access to their electronic health information. For the first time CMS is now proposing requirements that Medicaid the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program Medicare Advantage plans and Qualified Health Plans in the Federally-facilitated Exchanges must provide enrollees with immediate electronic access to medical claims and other health information electronically by 2020. In support of patient-centered healthcare CMS would also require these health care providers and plans to implement open data sharing technologies to support transitions of care as patients move between these plan types. By ensuring patients have easy access to their information and that information follows them on their healthcare journey we can reduce burden and eliminate redundant procedures and testing thus giving clinicians the time to focus on improving care coordination and ultimately health outcomes. \u201cToday\u2019s announcement builds on CMS\u2019 efforts to create a more interoperable healthcare system which improves patient access seamless data exchange and enhanced care coordination\u201d said CMS Administrator Seema Verma.\xa0 \u201cBy requiring health insurers to share their information in an accessible format by 2020 125 million patients will have access to their health claims information electronically. This unprecedented step toward a healthcare future where patients are able to obtain and share their health data securely and privately with just a few clicks is just the beginning of a digital data revolution that truly empowers American patients.\u201d The CMS rule also proposes to publicly report providers or hospitals that participate in \u201cinformation blocking\u201d practices that unreasonably limit the availability disclosure and use of electronic health information undermine efforts to improve interoperability. \xa0Making this information publicly available may incentivize providers and clinicians to refrain from such practices. ONC\u2019s proposed rule promotes secure and more immediate access to health information for patients and their healthcare providers and new tools allowing for more choice in care and treatment. Specifically the proposed rule calls on the healthcare industry to adopt standardized application programming interfaces (APIs) which will help allow individuals to securely and easily access structured and unstructured EHI formats using smartphones and other mobile devices.\xa0It also implements the information blocking provisions of the 21st Century Cures Act including identifying reasonable and necessary activities that do not constitute information blocking. The proposed rule helps ensure that patients can electronically access their electronic health information at no cost. The proposed rule also asks for comments on pricing information that could be included as part of their EHI and would help the public see the prices they are paying for their healthcare. \u201cBy supporting secure access of electronic health information and strongly discouraging information blocking the proposed rule supports the bi-partisan 21st Century Cures Act. The rule would support patients accessing and sharing their electronic health information while giving them the tools to shop for and coordinate their own health care\u201d said Don Rucker M.D. National Coordinator for Health IT. \u201cWe encourage everyone \u2013 patients patient advocates healthcare providers health IT developers health information networks application innovators and anyone else interested in the interoperability and transparency of health information \u2013 to share their comments on the proposed rule we posted today.\u201d Policies in the proposed CMS and ONC rules align to advance interoperability in several important ways. CMS proposes that entities must conform to the\xa0same advanced API standards as those proposed for certified health IT in the ONC proposed rule as well as including an aligned set of content and vocabulary standards for clinical data classes through the United States Core Data for Interoperability standard (USCDI). Together these proposed rules address both technical and healthcare industry factors that create barriers to the interoperability of health information and limit a patient\u2019s ability to access essential health information.\xa0Aligning these requirements for payers health care providers and health IT developers will help to drive an interoperable health IT infrastructure across systems ensuring providers and patients have access to health data when and where it is needed.

Making those prices more transparent is a significant step in President Trump\u2019s efforts to reform our prescription drug markets and put patients in charge of their own healthcare.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPatients have the right to know the prices of healthcare services and CMS is serious about empowering patients with this information across-the-board\u201d said CMS Administrator Seema Verma. \u201cToday\u2019s final rule is an important step toward achieving President Trump\u2019s vision for lowering prescription drug prices by bringing much-needed pricing transparency to the convoluted market for prescription drugs. Equipped with information on prescription drug prices patients will be better able to make informed decisions and demand value from pharmaceutical companies.\u201d</p> <p>In May 2018 President Trump and Secretary Azar introduced the <em><a data-vars-internal-link=""/sites/default/files/AmericanPatientsFirst.pdf"" href=""/sites/default/files/AmericanPatientsFirst.pdf"">American Patients First</a></em> blueprint to bring down prescription drug prices. The blueprint laid out four strategies for solving the problems patients face: boosting competition enhancing negotiation creating incentives for lower list prices and bringing down out-of-pocket costs.</p> <p>To create better incentives for lower list prices the blueprint called for HHS to consider requiring the inclusion of list prices in direct-to-consumer advertising. Less than a year later this final rule has been published to implement the vision laid out in the blueprint.</p> <p>Up until now drug companies were required to disclose the major side effects a drug can have\u2014but not the effect that buying the drug could have on your wallet. Patients deserve more transparency and this Administration is committed to delivering it.</p> <p>List prices matter to patients many of whom either pay the list price or prices based on the list price. For the forty-seven percent of Americans who have high-deductible health insurance plans the price they see in ads essentially is the price they pay until they meet their deductible. All seniors on Medicare Part D have coinsurance for certain types of drugs which means their out-of-pocket expenses are calculated as a share of list price.

On Wednesday Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar announced a final rule from the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) that will require direct-to-consumer television advertisements for prescription pharmaceuticals covered by Medicare or Medicaid to include the list price \u2013 the Wholesale Acquisition Cost \u2013 if that price is equal to or greater than $35 for a month\u2019s supply or the usual course of therapy. \u201cRequiring the inclusion of drugs\u2019 list prices in TV ads is the single most significant step any administration has taken toward a simple commitment: American patients deserve to know the prices of the healthcare they receive\u201d said HHS Secretary Alex Azar. \u201cPatients who are struggling with high drug costs are in that position because of the high list prices that drug companies set. Making those prices more transparent is a significant step in President Trump\u2019s efforts to reform our prescription drug markets and put patients in charge of their own healthcare.\u201d \u201cPatients have the right to know the prices of healthcare services and CMS is serious about empowering patients with this information across-the-board\u201d said CMS Administrator Seema Verma. \u201cToday\u2019s final rule is an important step toward achieving President Trump\u2019s vision for lowering prescription drug prices by bringing much-needed pricing transparency to the convoluted market for prescription drugs. Equipped with information on prescription drug prices patients will be better able to make informed decisions and demand value from pharmaceutical companies.\u201d In May 2018 President Trump and Secretary Azar introduced the American Patients First blueprint to bring down prescription drug prices. The blueprint laid out four strategies for solving the problems patients face: boosting competition enhancing negotiation creating incentives for lower list prices and bringing down out-of-pocket costs. To create better incentives for lower list prices the blueprint called for HHS to consider requiring the inclusion of list prices in direct-to-consumer advertising. Less than a year later this final rule has been published to implement the vision laid out in the blueprint. Up until now drug companies were required to disclose the major side effects a drug can have\u2014but not the effect that buying the drug could have on your wallet. Patients deserve more transparency and this Administration is committed to delivering it. List prices matter to patients many of whom either pay the list price or prices based on the list price. For the forty-seven percent of Americans who have high-deductible health insurance plans the price they see in ads essentially is the price they pay until they meet their deductible. All seniors on Medicare Part D have coinsurance for certain types of drugs which means their out-of-pocket expenses are calculated as a share of list price. List prices are also what patients pay if a drug is not on their insurance formulary. President Trump has already done more than any President to lower drug prices for American patients and HHS will continue to deliver solutions as laid out in the American Patients First blueprint to improve drug price transparency and inform consumer decision making. HHS is reviewing comments on a number of other proposed rules to fix opaque systems change perverse incentives and put American patients first.

These programs are built from the foundations laid in the $1\xa0billion provided to states and territories through SAMHSA\u2019s Opioid State Targeted Response (STR) program. SAMHSA has complemented the work of the STR program with a national center of excellence that provides technical assistance and training to leverage local subject matter experts at the community level to sharpen treatment access and delivery. SAMHSA also operates a 24/7 national Helpline that people can call to find treatment referral resources for mental health or substance use disorders: 800-662-HELP (4357). People can visit https://findtreatment.samhsa.gov/ to locate those resources as well.

27,https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2019/04/22/hhs-deliver-value-based-transformation-primary-care.html,"[<p class=""breadcrumb""><a href=""/"">Home</a> &gt; <a href=""/about"">About</a> &gt; <a href=""/about/news"">News</a> &gt; HHS To Deliver Value-Based Transformation in Primary Care</p> <p>Today U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex Azar and Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) Administrator Seema Verma are announcing the CMS Primary Cares Initiative a new set of payment models that will transform primary care to deliver better value for patients throughout the healthcare system. Building on the lessons learned from and experiences of the previous models the CMS Primary Cares Initiative will reduce administrative burdens and empower primary care providers to spend more time caring for patients while reducing overall health care costs. The models were developed by the Innovation Center under the leadership of Adam Boehler and are part of Secretary Azar\u2019s value-based transformation initiative.</p> <p>\u201cFor years policymakers have talked about building an American healthcare system that focuses on primary care pays for value and places the patient at the center. These new models represent the biggest step ever taken toward that vision\u201d said HHS Secretary Alex Azar. \u201cBuilding on the experience of previous models and ideas of past administrations these models will test out paying for health and outcomes rather than procedures on a much larger scale than ever before. These models can serve as an inflection point for value-based transformation of our healthcare system and American patients and providers will be the first ones to benefit.\u201d</p> <p>Empirical evidence shows that strengthening primary care is associated with higher quality better outcomes and lower costs within and across major population subgroups. Despite this evidence primary care spending accounts for a small portion of total cost of care and is even lower for patients with complex chronic conditions. Primary care clinicians serve on the front lines of the healthcare delivery system furnishing services across a wide range of specialties from family medicine to behavioral health to gerontology. For many patients the primary care clinician is the first point of contact with the healthcare delivery system. CMS\u2019s experience with innovative models programs and demonstrations to date have shown that when incentives for primary care clinicians are aligned to reward the provision of high value care the quality and cost effectiveness of patient care improves.</p> <p>\u201cAs we seek to unleash innovation in our health care system we recognize that the road to value must have as many lanes as possible\u201d said CMS Administrator Seema Verma. \u201cOur Primary Cares Initiative is designed to give clinicians different options that advance our goal to deliver better care at a lower cost while allowing clinicians to focus on what they do best: treating patients.\u201d</p> <p>Administered through the CMS Innovation Center the CMS Primary Cares Initiative will provide primary care practices and other providers with five new payment model options under two paths:</p> <p><strong>Primary Care First</strong> and <strong>Direct Contracting</strong>.</p> <p>The five payment model options are:</p> <p>The Primary Care First (PCF) payment model options will test whether financial risk and performance based payments that reward primary care practitioners and other clinicians for easily understood actionable outcomes will reduce total Medicare expenditures preserve or enhance quality of care and improve patient health outcomes. PCF will provide payment to practices through a simplified total monthly payment that allows clinicians to focus on caring for patients rather than their revenue cycle. PCF also includes a payment model option that provides higher payments to practices that specialize in care for high need patients including those with complex chronic needs and seriously ill populations (SIP).</p> <p>Both models under PCF incentivize providers to reduce hospital utilization and total cost of care by potentially significantly rewarding them through performance-based payment adjustments based on their performance. \xa0These models seek to improve quality of care specifically patients\u2019 experiences of care and key outcome-based clinical quality measures which may include controlling high blood pressure managing diabetes mellitus and screening for colorectal cancer. PCF will be tested for five years and is scheduled to begin in January 2020. A second application round is also planned for participants starting in January 2021.</p> <p>Like the PCF payment model options the Direct Contracting (DC) payment model options are also focused on transforming primary care allowing health care providers to take greater control of managing the costs of care for an aligned population of Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) beneficiaries. While the PCF models are focused on individual primary care practice sites the DC payment model options aim to engage a wider variety of organizations that have experience taking on financial risk and serving larger patient populations such as Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) Medicare Advantage (MA) plans and Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs).\xa0 The DC payment model options are designed to create a competitive delivery system environment where organizations offering greater efficiencies and better quality of care will be financially rewarded. The payment model options include a focus on care for patients with complex chronic needs and SIPs as well as a voluntary alignment option that allows beneficiaries to align with the health care provider of their choosing.</p> <p>Depending on the DC payment model option in which an organization is participating the model participant will receive a fixed monthly payment that can range from a portion of anticipated primary care costs to the total cost of care. Participants in the global payment model option will ultimately bear full financial risk while those in the professional payment model option will share risk with CMS. This will provide prospective model participants a range of financial risk arrangements from which to choose while providing a more predictable revenue stream and reducing health care provider burden commensurate with level of financial risk.</p> <p>In addition CMS is seeking public comment on one DC payment model option with an expected performance period launch in January 2021. The Geographic Population-Based option is designed to offer innovative organizations the opportunity to assume responsibility for the total cost of care and health needs of a population in a defined target region. Driving accountability to a local level empowers communities to devise strategies best designed to meet their health care needs. Given the novelty of this option we are seeking public comment through a new Request for Information.</p> <p>Together CMS anticipates these five payment model options administered under the Primary Cares Initiative could:\xa0</p> <p>All five payment model options focus on supporting care for patients who have chronic conditions and serious illnesses. Through the PCF payment model options high need patients with serious illness who do not have a primary care practitioner or care coordination and indicate an interest in receiving care from a practice participating in the model will be assigned to a model participant. Participating practices that choose to care for SIP patients will be required to provide care to clinically stabilize the patient. All payment model options include enhancements to encourage participation of providers who are focused on care for these populations.</p> <p>CMS based the design of these payment model options on considerable stakeholder input. The models draw from Physician-Focused Payment Model Technical Advisory Committee (PTAC) review of proposals including but not limited to <em>The Advanced Primary Care Model</em> from the American Academy of Family Physicians <em>An Innovative Model for Primary Care Office Payment</em> from Jean Antonucci MD <em>The Patient and Caregiver Support for Serious Illness Model</em> from the American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine and <em>The Advanced Care Model</em> from the Coalition to Transform Advanced Care. All payment model options are responsive to stakeholder feedback that we received from advanced primary care practices expressing interest in accepting increased financial risk in exchange for greater flexibility and fewer requirements.</p> <p>For a fact sheet on the CMS Primary Care First payment model options please visit <a data-vars-outbound-link=""https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/primary-care-first-foster-independence-reward-outcomes"" href=""https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/primary-care-first-foster-independence-reward-outcomes"">https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/primary-care-first-foster-independence-reward-outcomes</a>.

Building on the lessons learned from and experiences of the previous models the CMS Primary Cares Initiative will reduce administrative burdens and empower primary care providers to spend more time caring for patients while reducing overall health care costs. The models were developed by the Innovation Center under the leadership of Adam Boehler and are part of Secretary Azar\u2019s value-based transformation initiative. \u201cFor years policymakers have talked about building an American healthcare system that focuses on primary care pays for value and places the patient at the center. These new models represent the biggest step ever taken toward that vision\u201d said HHS Secretary Alex Azar. \u201cBuilding on the experience of previous models and ideas of past administrations these models will test out paying for health and outcomes rather than procedures on a much larger scale than ever before. These models can serve as an inflection point for value-based transformation of our healthcare system and American patients and providers will be the first ones to benefit.\u201d Empirical evidence shows that strengthening primary care is associated with higher quality better outcomes and lower costs within and across major population subgroups. Despite this evidence primary care spending accounts for a small portion of total cost of care and is even lower for patients with complex chronic conditions. Primary care clinicians serve on the front lines of the healthcare delivery system furnishing services across a wide range of specialties from family medicine to behavioral health to gerontology. For many patients the primary care clinician is the first point of contact with the healthcare delivery system. CMS\u2019s experience with innovative models programs and demonstrations to date have shown that when incentives for primary care clinicians are aligned to reward the provision of high value care the quality and cost effectiveness of patient care improves. \u201cAs we seek to unleash innovation in our health care system we recognize that the road to value must have as many lanes as possible\u201d said CMS Administrator Seema Verma. \u201cOur Primary Cares Initiative is designed to give clinicians different options that advance our goal to deliver better care at a lower cost while allowing clinicians to focus on what they do best: treating patients.\u201d Administered through the CMS Innovation Center the CMS Primary Cares Initiative will provide primary care practices and other providers with five new payment model options under two paths: Primary Care First and Direct Contracting. The five payment model options are: The Primary Care First (PCF) payment model options will test whether financial risk and performance based payments that reward primary care practitioners and other clinicians for easily understood actionable outcomes will reduce total Medicare expenditures preserve or enhance quality of care and improve patient health outcomes. PCF will provide payment to practices through a simplified total monthly payment that allows clinicians to focus on caring for patients rather than their revenue cycle. PCF also includes a payment model option that provides higher payments to practices that specialize in care for high need patients including those with complex chronic needs and seriously ill populations (SIP). Both models under PCF incentivize providers to reduce hospital utilization and total cost of care by potentially significantly rewarding them through performance-based payment adjustments based on their performance. \xa0These models seek to improve quality of care specifically patients\u2019 experiences of care and key outcome-based clinical quality measures which may include controlling high blood pressure managing diabetes mellitus and screening for colorectal cancer. PCF will be tested for five years and is scheduled to begin in January 2020. A second application round is also planned for participants starting in January 2021. Like the PCF payment model options the Direct Contracting (DC) payment model options are also focused on transforming primary care allowing health care providers to take greater control of managing the costs of care for an aligned population of Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) beneficiaries. While the PCF models are focused on individual primary care practice sites the DC payment model options aim to engage a wider variety of organizations that have experience taking on financial risk and serving larger patient populations such as Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) Medicare Advantage (MA) plans and Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs).\xa0 The DC payment model options are designed to create a competitive delivery system environment where organizations offering greater efficiencies and better quality of care will be financially rewarded. The payment model options include a focus on care for patients with complex chronic needs and SIPs as well as a voluntary alignment option that allows beneficiaries to align with the health care provider of their choosing. Depending on the DC payment model option in which an organization is participating the model participant will receive a fixed monthly payment that can range from a portion of anticipated primary care costs to the total cost of care. Participants in the global payment model option will ultimately bear full financial risk while those in the professional payment model option will share risk with CMS. This will provide prospective model participants a range of financial risk arrangements from which to choose while providing a more predictable revenue stream and reducing health care provider burden commensurate with level of financial risk. In addition CMS is seeking public comment on one DC payment model option with an expected performance period launch in January 2021. The Geographic Population-Based option is designed to offer innovative organizations the opportunity to assume responsibility for the total cost of care and health needs of a population in a defined target region. Driving accountability to a local level empowers communities to devise strategies best designed to meet their health care needs. Given the novelty of this option we are seeking public comment through a new Request for Information. Together CMS anticipates these five payment model options administered under the Primary Cares Initiative could:\xa0 All five payment model options focus on supporting care for patients who have chronic conditions and serious illnesses. Through the PCF payment model options high need patients with serious illness who do not have a primary care practitioner or care coordination and indicate an interest in receiving care from a practice participating in the model will be assigned to a model participant. Participating practices that choose to care for SIP patients will be required to provide care to clinically stabilize the patient. All payment model options include enhancements to encourage participation of providers who are focused on care for these populations. CMS based the design of these payment model options on considerable stakeholder input. The models draw from Physician-Focused Payment Model Technical Advisory Committee (PTAC) review of proposals including but not limited to The Advanced Primary Care Model from the American Academy of Family Physicians An Innovative Model for Primary Care Office Payment from Jean Antonucci MD The Patient and Caregiver Support for Serious Illness Model from the American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine and The Advanced Care Model from the Coalition to Transform Advanced Care. All payment model options are responsive to stakeholder feedback that we received from advanced primary care practices expressing interest in accepting increased financial risk in exchange for greater flexibility and fewer requirements.

33,https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2019/04/19/hhs-extends-comment-period-for-proposed-rules-to-improve-the-interoperability-of-electronic-health-information.html,"[<p class=""breadcrumb""><a href=""/"">Home</a> &gt; <a href=""/about"">About</a> &gt; <a href=""/about/news"">News</a> &gt; HHS Extends Comment Period for Proposed Rules to Improve the Interoperability of Electronic Health Information </p> <p>Today the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced it is extending the public comment period by 30 days for two proposed regulations aimed at promoting the interoperability of health information technology (health IT) and enabling patients to electronically access their health information. The new deadline for the submission of comments \u2013 June 3 2019 \u2013 will allow additional time for the public to review the proposed regulations.</p> <p>The extension of the public comment period coincides with a release by the HHS Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) of the second draft of the <a data-vars-outbound-link=""http://www.healthit.gov/TEFCA"" href=""http://www.healthit.gov/TEFCA"">Trusted Exchange Framework and Common Agreement</a> along with a related Notice of Funding Opportunity. HHS also today released of a set of frequently asked questions (FAQs) from the Office for Civil Rights (OCR).</p> <p>The FAQs address the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) right of access as it relates to apps designated by individual patients and application programming interfaces (APIs) used by a healthcare provider\u2019s electronic health record (EHR) system. The FAQs clarify that once protected health information has been shared with a third-party app as directed by the individual the HIPAA covered entity will not be liable under HIPAA for subsequent use or disclosure of electronic protected health information provided the app developer is not itself a business associate of a covered entity or other business associate.</p> <p>On February 11 2019 HHS announced two <a data-vars-outbound-link=""https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2019/02/11/hhs-proposes-new-rules-improve-interoperability-electronic-health-information.html"" href=""/about/news/2019/02/11/hhs-proposes-new-rules-improve-interoperability-electronic-health-information.html"">proposed rules</a> to support the seamless and secure access exchange and use of electronic health information (with <em>Federal Register</em> publication on March 4 2019). The rules would increase choice and competition while fostering innovation that promotes patient electronic access to and control over their health information. Together the proposed rules address both technical and healthcare industry factors that create barriers to the interoperability of health information and limit a patient\u2019s ability to access essential health information. Addressing those challenges will help to drive an interoperable health IT infrastructure across systems enabling healthcare providers and patients to have access to health data when and where it is needed.</p> <p>This extension responds to requests from a variety of stakeholders including healthcare provider organizations and industry representatives. The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) and ONC understand that both rules include a range of issues having major effects on healthcare. The extension of the public comment deadline will maximize the opportunity for meaningful input and further the overall objective to obtain public input on the proposed provisions to move the healthcare ecosystem in the direction of interoperability.</p> <p>For more information on the ONC proposed rule visit: <a

Electronic Health Information  Today the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced it is extending the public comment period by 30 days for two proposed regulations aimed at promoting the interoperability of health information technology (health IT) and enabling patients to electronically access their health information. The new deadline for the submission of comments \u2013 June 3 2019 \u2013 will allow additional time for the public to review the proposed regulations. The extension of the public comment period coincides with a release by the HHS Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) of the second draft of the Trusted Exchange Framework and Common Agreement along with a related Notice of Funding Opportunity. HHS also today released of a set of frequently asked questions (FAQs) from the Office for Civil Rights (OCR). The FAQs address the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) right of access as it relates to apps designated by individual patients and application programming interfaces (APIs) used by a healthcare provider\u2019s electronic health record (EHR) system. The FAQs clarify that once protected health information has been shared with a third-party app as directed by the individual the HIPAA covered entity will not be liable under HIPAA for subsequent use or disclosure of electronic protected health information provided the app developer is not itself a business associate of a covered entity or other business associate. On February 11 2019 HHS announced two proposed rules to support the seamless and secure access exchange and use of electronic health information (with Federal Register publication on March 4 2019). The rules would increase choice and competition while fostering innovation that promotes patient electronic access to and control over their health information. Together the proposed rules address both technical and healthcare industry factors that create barriers to the interoperability of health information and limit a patient\u2019s ability to access essential health information. Addressing those challenges will help to drive an interoperable health IT infrastructure across systems enabling healthcare providers and patients to have access to health data when and where it is needed. This extension responds to requests from a variety of stakeholders including healthcare provider organizations and industry representatives. The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) and ONC understand that both rules include a range of issues having major effects on healthcare. The extension of the public comment deadline will maximize the opportunity for meaningful input and further the overall objective to obtain public input on the proposed provisions to move the healthcare ecosystem in the direction of interoperability.

Since then the need to clarify and ensure compliance with the statutory intent of the program has only increased. The major provisions of the 2019 Title X regulation are summarized below.</p> <p>Ensures program integrity consistent with statutory purpose.</p> <p>Summary: Of particular significance the 2019 regulation focuses on compliance with the underlying Title X statute.

As such it requires medically necessary referrals such as referrals for prenatal care. To preserve open communication between the patient and the healthcare provider the regulation permits but no longer requires nondirective pregnancy counseling including nondirective counseling on abortion.\xa0 Consistent with the statutory requirement that no funds may be expended where abortion is a method of family planning this regulation no longer requires and affirmatively prohibits referral for abortion as a method of family planning.</p> <p>Protects women and children from victimization.</p> <p>Summary: This final rule includes a stronger focus on protecting women and children from being victimized by child abuse child molestation sexual abuse rape incest intimate partner violence and trafficking. The regulation requires all Title X clinics to provide annual training for staff and to have a site-specific protocol in place to report crime and protect victims.</p> <p>Boosts meaningful family communication especially in adolescent family planning.</p> <p>Summary: Almost 1 in 5 Title X clients are adolescents. This final rule requires clinics to meaningfully encourage parent/child communication. As required by law Title X clinics must encourage family participation in family planning decision-making particularly a minor\u2019s decision to seek family planning services.\xa0 As part of counseling of minors they should provide practical ways to begin \u2013 and maintain \u2013 such communication.</p> <p>Expands coverage partnerships and innovation.</p> <p>Summary: The final rule adds provisions that are designed to increase the number of patients served within the Title X program by placing special focus on reaching more unserved or underserved areas by increasing innovation within the program expanding diversity of grantees and partners and clarifying the flexibility that program directors have to provide services to those in need of family planning services.</p> <p>Returns Title X flexibility to states and other grantees.</p> <p>Summary: The final rule officially revokes a 2016 Title X regulation that limited the ability of States and other Title X grantees to exercise flexibility in choosing their subrecipients.

Fact Sheet: Final Title X Rule Detailing Family Planning Grant Program On February 22 2019 the Department of Health and Human Services issued a final rule to revise the regulations governing the Title X family planning program. Background Title X is the only federal program dedicated solely to the provision of family planning and related preventive services tailored to individual needs with priority given to those from low income families. Established in 1970 the program provides funding \u201cto assist in the establishment and operation of voluntary family planning projects which shall offer a broad range of acceptable and effective family planning methods and services (including natural family planning methods infertility services and services for adolescents).\u201d1 Pursuant to Congressional mandate family participation is to be encouraged particularly in services involving adolescents. And from the start Congress was clear that Title X funds cannot be used to support abortion.2 The Title X program serves approximately 4 million clients every year. This final rule ensures that grants and contracts awarded under this program fully comply with the statutory program integrity requirements thereby fulfilling the purpose of Title X so that more women and men can receive services that help them consider and achieve both their short-term and long-term family planning needs. Summary of Final Rule The regulations governing the Title X program have not been substantially updated since 2000. Since then the need to clarify and ensure compliance with the statutory intent of the program has only increased. The major provisions of the 2019 Title X regulation are summarized below. Ensures program integrity consistent with statutory purpose. Summary: Of particular significance the 2019 regulation focuses on compliance with the underlying Title X statute. In addition it provides clarity between permissible Title X activities and impermissible ones by requiring clear financial and physical separation for Title X funded programs from programs and facilities where abortion is a method of family planning. Protects the patient/healthcare provider relationship. Summary: The 2019 regulation places a high priority on preserving the patient/healthcare provider relationship in order to promote optimal health for every Title X patient. As such it requires medically necessary referrals such as referrals for prenatal care. To preserve open communication between the patient and the healthcare provider the regulation permits but no longer requires nondirective pregnancy counseling including nondirective counseling on abortion.\xa0 Consistent with the statutory requirement that no funds may be expended where abortion is a method of family planning this regulation no longer requires and affirmatively prohibits referral for abortion as a method of family planning. Protects women and children from victimization. Summary: This final rule includes a stronger focus on protecting women and children from being victimized by child abuse child molestation sexual abuse rape incest intimate partner violence and trafficking. The regulation requires all Title X clinics to provide annual training for staff and to have a site-specific protocol in place to report crime and protect victims. Boosts meaningful family communication especially in adolescent family planning. Summary: Almost 1 in 5 Title X clients are adolescents. This final rule requires clinics to meaningfully encourage parent/child communication. As required by law Title X clinics must encourage family participation in family planning decision-making particularly a minor\u2019s decision to seek family planning services.\xa0 As part of counseling of minors they should provide practical ways to begin \u2013 and maintain \u2013 such communication. Expands coverage partnerships and innovation. Summary: The final rule adds provisions that are designed to increase the number of patients served within the Title X program by placing special focus on reaching more unserved or underserved areas by increasing innovation within the program expanding diversity of grantees and partners and clarifying the flexibility that program directors have to provide services to those in need of family planning services. Returns Title X flexibility to states and other grantees. Summary: The final rule officially revokes a 2016 Title X regulation that limited the ability of States and other Title X grantees to exercise flexibility in choosing their subrecipients. This frees grantees to select clinical providers that meet the Title X needs of their patients consistent with local needs and sensibilities and within the statutory and regulatory guidelines.

Since arriving in Geneva Switzerland Secretary Azar has delivered the U.S. plenary statement and participated in multiple bilateral meetings with his counterparts.</p> <p>In his plenary address Secretary Azar emphasized the importance of the World Health Organization (WHO) focusing on its core mission of supporting global public health and health security. He noted that international assistance and a new vaccine have helped mitigate the current Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) but also emphasized that \u201cthe outbreak is not under control.\u201d</p> <p>He thanked WHO Director-General Tedros for his personal leadership on the Ebola issue and commitment to WHO reform generally and also emphasized that WHO must be more welcoming to contributions from the private sector. Finally he noted that President Trump has undertaken an aggressive campaign to bring down drug prices over the last year including the first-ever proposal by a President to use reference pricing and noted that there are many potential areas for international cooperation on access to safe effective and affordable medicines.</p> <p>On the sidelines of the WHA Secretary Azar has met with Ma Xiaowei Minister of China\u2019s National Health Commission. They discussed the U.S. and China\u2019s strong collaboration on health issues including immunizations infectious diseases and global health security.</p> <p>He met with Dr. Matshidiso Moeti of the WHO Regional Office for Africa.

The clinical research showed that taken together the three steps of the triple protocol remove 99.9 percent of chemical contamination.</p> <p>The latest clinical evidence indicates that the <a data-vars-outbound-link=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196064418305730"" href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196064418305730"">triple protocol</a> approach to decontamination is faster and more effective than traditional methods for treating chemically contaminated patients. The research also demonstrated that immediate \u201cdry\u201d decontamination using any available absorbent material can be highly effective as a stand-alone procedure when performed under the instruction of first responders removing up to 99 percent of contamination.</p> <p>\u201cDisrobing and dry decontamination are steps that can be taken by the affected individuals themselves under the direction of response personnel without waiting for equipment set up\u201d Bright noted. \u201cThe addition of dry decontamination to the overall response also minimizes the accumulation of hazardous material in the subsequent decontamination steps.\u201d</p> <p>The guidance suggests that emergency plans should address how the community will take specific preparedness actions. One important action would be to make enough absorbent materials available on emergency response vehicles so that emergency dry decontamination can begin as quickly as possible. Plans also should include how the community will provide washcloths and towels for use in wet decontamination and blankets or temporary clothes to protect patients from hypothermia afterward.

The decision-support tool and guidance as well as the scientific studies on which they are based were completed under a contract between the University of Hertfordshire in the United Kingdom and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) part of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. \u201cWhen we began working with the University of Hertfordshire six years ago our goal was to provide emergency managers and first responders with scientific evidence and guidance they needed to make fundamental and fast decisions on how to save the greatest number of lives in chemical emergencies\u201d said BARDA Director Rick Bright Ph.D. \u201cBuilding on the\xa0 first ground-breaking studies and\xa0 guidance we now have a larger body of scientific evidence that is incorporated into the latest guidance and we have made it even\xa0 easier for responders to use in preparing for disasters and on the scene in an emergency.\u201d This second edition of the guidance called Primary Response Incident Scene Management or PRISM incorporates new scientific evidence on emergency self-decontamination hair decontamination the interactions of chemicals with hair and the effects of a combined decontamination strategy referred to as the \u201ctriple protocol.\u201d PRISM introduces the \u201ctriple protocol\u201d comprised of disrobing and conducting dry decontamination wet decontamination using the ladder pipe system with high volume/low pressure water deluges from fire trucks and technical (or specialist) decontamination. The clinical research showed that taken together the three steps of the triple protocol remove 99.9 percent of chemical contamination. The latest clinical evidence indicates that the triple protocol approach to decontamination is faster and more effective than traditional methods for treating chemically contaminated patients. The research also demonstrated that immediate \u201cdry\u201d decontamination using any available absorbent material can be highly effective as a stand-alone procedure when performed under the instruction of first responders removing up to 99 percent of contamination. \u201cDisrobing and dry decontamination are steps that can be taken by the affected individuals themselves under the direction of response personnel without waiting for equipment set up\u201d Bright noted. \u201cThe addition of dry decontamination to the overall response also minimizes the accumulation of hazardous material in the subsequent decontamination steps.\u201d The guidance suggests that emergency plans should address how the community will take specific preparedness actions. One important action would be to make enough absorbent materials available on emergency response vehicles so that emergency dry decontamination can begin as quickly as possible. Plans also should include how the community will provide washcloths and towels for use in wet decontamination and blankets or temporary clothes to protect patients from hypothermia afterward. Hypothermia would be of particular concern in the winter in colder areas. To further aid first responders and emergency managers experts from BARDA ASPR and the National Library of Medicine (NLM) at the National Institutes of Health collaborated with the University of Hertfordshire researchers to devise a decision-support tool called ASPIRE or the Algorithm Suggesting Proportionate Incident Response Engagement. The tool helps responders determine which decontamination approaches will work best in a given situation. Using ASPIRE emergency management planners and responders can tailor decontamination plans and emergency responses based on the chemical and the type of exposure how quickly the chemical evaporates and the amount of time that has passed since exposure. ASPIRE and the guidance are integrated into the Chemical Hazards Emergency Medical Management (CHEMM) web-based resource created by ASPR and NLM as part of a suite of preparedness and emergency response tools that includes the CHEMM Intelligent Syndromes Tool (CHEMM-IST) Dermal Exposure Risk Management and Logic for Emergency Preparedness and Response (DERMaL\xa0eToolkit) and now ASPIRE. The guidance and ASPIRE also are incorporated into the latest edition of the WISER CHEMM mobile app which is expected to be available in the coming days. The PRISM guidance splits its information into three online volumes. The first volume explains the technical and scientific evidence identifies capability gaps and describes the corresponding rationale which underpins the revised incident response process. The second volume focuses on the practical aspects of the incident response with an accompanying rationale but no supporting technical information. This volume is intended for use in developing training and exercises.
