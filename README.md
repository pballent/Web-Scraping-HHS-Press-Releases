# Web-Scraping-HHS-Press-Releases
I wanted to create a starting point for doing text analysis on HHS Press Releases over time, and to teach myself a bit of Python, so I created this script to go to the index page for HHS's press releases, find all links, and go scrape and clean their text. This script does that although only for one year at a time.

# Next steps
- Include multiple years in the loop
- Parse out the exact date from each release to a new column
- Perform text mining such as word frequency time series or tf_df to analyze changes over time
- Complete cleaning of the text to remove the buttons and other artifacts from the webpages
