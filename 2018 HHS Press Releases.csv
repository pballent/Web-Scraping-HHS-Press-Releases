During his opening remarks the Secretary noted that the private sector has a vested interest and critical role to play in addressing both communicable and noncommunicable diseases because no one benefits from an unhealthy workforce. He further communicated how private sector innovation and expertise can be helpful particularly in standing up healthcare infrastructure and combating antimicrobial resistance. Throughout the day Secretary Azar participated in bilateral meetings with public health officials from Canada Argentina India and Rwanda. In addition to strengthening relationships in support of improved global health security discussions included other key priorities like opioid abuse and addiction challenges in healthcare delivery and prescription drug pricing.

Under the Affordable Care Act employer-provided health insurance plans are required to cover certain \u201cpreventative services\u201d \u2013 which were defined through guidance by the Obama Administration as including all contraception methods approved by the Food and Drug Administration including methods viewed by many as abortifacients and sterilization procedures.</p> <p>In October 2017 the Trump Administration issued two interim final rules providing an exemption for those who had sincerely held religious or moral objections to such coverage while seeking public comment on the rules. The first of today\u2019s final rules provides an exemption from the contraceptive coverage mandate to entities that object to services covered by the mandate on the basis of sincerely held religious beliefs. The second final rule provides protections to nonprofit organizations and small businesses that have non-religious moral convictions opposing services covered by the mandate. The religious and moral exemptions provided by these rules also apply to institutions of education issuers and individuals. The Departments are not extending the moral exemption to publicly traded businesses or either exemption to government entities.</p> <p>Key Facts:</p> <p>To read a fact sheet with additional

Today the Departments of Health and Human Services Treasury and Labor released two final rules to provide conscience protections for Americans who have a religious or moral objection to health insurance that covers contraception methods. Under the Affordable Care Act employer-provided health insurance plans are required to cover certain \u201cpreventative services\u201d \u2013 which were defined through guidance by the Obama Administration as including all contraception methods approved by the Food and Drug Administration including methods viewed by many as abortifacients and sterilization procedures. In October 2017 the Trump Administration issued two interim final rules providing an exemption for those who had sincerely held religious or moral objections to such coverage while seeking public comment on the rules. The first of today\u2019s final rules provides an exemption from the contraceptive coverage mandate to entities that object to services covered by the mandate on the basis of sincerely held religious beliefs. The second final rule provides protections to nonprofit organizations and small businesses that have non-religious moral convictions opposing services covered by the mandate. The religious and moral exemptions provided by these rules also apply to institutions of education issuers and individuals. The Departments are not extending the moral exemption to publicly traded businesses or either exemption to government entities.

The four volume publication aims to provide voluntary cybersecurity practices to healthcare organizations of all types and sizes ranging from local clinics to large hospital systems.</p> <p>The industry-led effort was in response to a mandate set forth by the Cybersecurity Act of 2015 Section 405(d) to develop practical cybersecurity guidelines to cost-effectively reduce cybersecurity risks for the healthcare industry. The publication marks the culmination of a two-year effort that brought together over 150 cybersecurity and healthcare experts from industry and the government under the Healthcare and Public Health (HPH) Sector Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience Public-Private Partnership. It was the result of a true public-private partnership to better secure the nation\u2019s health systems.</p> <p>\u201cCybersecurity is everyone\u2019s responsibility.\xa0 It is the responsibility of every organization working in healthcare and public health.\xa0 In all of our efforts we must recognize and leverage the value of partnerships among government and industry stakeholders to tackle the shared problems collaboratively\u201d said Janet Vogel HHS Acting Chief Information Security Officer.</p> <p>Technologies are vital to the healthcare industry and help provide life-saving treatments and improve patient care. However these same technologies are vulnerable to myriad attacks from adversaries ranging from criminals and hacktivists to nation-states. These technologies can be exploited to gain access to personal patient data or render entire hospital systems inoperable. Recent cyber-attacks against the nation\u2019s healthcare industry continue to highlight the importance of ensuring these technologies are safe and secure.</p> <p>\u201cThe healthcare industry is truly a varied digital ecosystem. We heard loud and clear through this process that providers need actionable and practical advice tailored to their needs to manage modern cyber threats. That is exactly what this resource delivers; recommendations stratified by the size of the organization written for both the clinician as well as the IT subject matter expert.\u201d said Erik Decker industry co-lead and Chief Information Security and Privacy Officer for the University of Chicago Medicine.\xa0</p> <p>The HICP publication aims to provide cybersecurity practices for this vast diverse and open sector to ultimately improve the security and safety of patients. The main document of the publication explores the five most relevant and current threats to the industry. It also recommends 10 Cybersecurity Practices to help mitigate these threats. The main document presents real-life events and statistics that demonstrate the financial and patient care impacts of cyber incidents.\xa0 It also lays out a call to action for all industry stakeholders from C-suite executives and healthcare practitioners to IT security professionals that protective and preventive measures must be taken now. The publication also includes two technical volumes geared for IT and IT security professionals. Technical Volume 1 focuses on cybersecurity practices for small healthcare organizations while Technical Volume 2 focuses on practices for medium and large healthcare organizations. The last volume provides resources and templates that organizations can leverage to assess their own cybersecurity posture as well develop policies and procedures.</p> <p>This publication demonstrates the Department\u2019s continued commitment to enhancing the security and resilience of the HPH Sector. Cybersecurity remains a top priority for HHS. HHS recognizes the importance of partnering with private industry especially the healthcare critical infrastructure partners represented by the Health Sector Coordinating Council to meet this milestone achievement. In the coming months the Department will work with industry stakeholders to raise awareness and implement the recommended cybersecurity practices across the sector.

Jerome M. Adams issued an advisory today stressing the importance of protecting children from a lifetime of nicotine addiction and associated health risks by immediately addressing the epidemic of youth e-cigarette use.</p> <p>E-cigarette use among youth has skyrocketed in the past year at a rate of epidemic proportions. According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s National Youth Tobacco Survey the percentage of high school-age children reporting past 30-day use of e-cigarettes rose by more than 75 percent between 2017 and 2018. Use among middle school-age children also increased nearly 50 percent.</p> <p>Data from National Institutes of Health\u2019s Monitoring the Future survey also shows that America\u2019s teens reported a dramatic increase in their use of e-cigarettes in just a single year with 37.3 percent of 12th graders reporting use in the past 12 months compared to 27.8 percent in 2017.</p> <p>\u201cWe need to protect our kids from all tobacco products including all shapes and sizes of e-cigarettes\u201d said Adams. \u201cEveryone can play an important role in protecting our nation\u2019s young people from the risks of e-cigarettes.\u201d</p> <p>The surge in e-cigarette use among our nation\u2019s youth has been fueled by newer cartridge-based devices that have become increasingly popular. Many of these e-cigarettes look like a USB flash drive making them easy to conceal. One of the most commonly sold versions is JUUL which now has more than a 70 percent share of the cartridge-based e-cigarette market in the United States. A typical JUUL cartridge or \u201cpod\u201d contains about as much nicotine as a pack of 20 regular cigarettes.</p> <p>\u201cIn the data sets we use we have never seen use of any substance by America\u2019s young people rise as rapidly as e-cigarette use is rising\u201d said HHS Secretary Alex Azar. \u201cCombustible cigarettes remain the leading cause of preventable death in the United States and providing an effective off-ramp\xa0for adults\xa0who want to quit using them is a public health priority. But we cannot allow e-cigarettes to become an on-ramp to nicotine addiction for younger Americans. HHS\xa0has been and will continue\xa0developing a comprehensive balanced\xa0policy\xa0approach to this challenge.\u201d</p> <p>As noted in the 2016 Surgeon General\u2019s report on E-cigarette Use Among Youth and Young Adults e-cigarette use poses a significant \u2013 and avoidable \u2013 health risk to young people. Besides increasing the possibility of addiction and long-term harm to brain development and respiratory health e-cigarette use may also lead to the use of regular cigarettes that can do even more damage to the body.</p> <p>\u201cWe have evidence-based strategies to prevent tobacco use that can be applied to e-cigarettes.\u201d said Adams. \u201cWe must take action now to protect the health of our nation\u2019s young people.\u201d</p> <p>For facts about the risk of e-cigarettes and how to protect our youth visit: <a data-vars-outbound-link=""https://e-cigarettes.surgeongeneral.gov/"" href=""https://e-cigarettes.surgeongeneral.gov/"">e-cigarettes.surgeongeneral.gov</a>.</p> <p>Enter your email:</p> <p>Receive latest updates</p> <p><a href=""/rss/news.xml""><img alt=""Subscribe to our RSS"" class=""rss-updates"" src=""/sites/all/themes/project_h/css/images/rss-button.png""/></a></p> <p><a href=""/about/news/contacts/index.html#media-info"">HHS Media Information</a><br/><a href=""/about/news/contacts/index.html#aspa-press-contact"">ASPA Press Contacts</a><br/><a href=""/about/news/contacts/index.html#agency-press-contact"">HHS Agency Press Contacts</a></p> <p><strong><a class=""view-all"" href=""/about/news/contacts/index.html"">View all</a></strong></p> <p>\n<a addthis:userid=""HHS"" alt=""Visit the HHS Facebook account"" class=""addthis_button_facebook_follow"" target=""_parent"" title=""Visit the HHS Facebook account""><img alt=""Visit the HHS Facebook account"" src=""/sites/all/themes/project_h/css/images/facebook-icon-32x32.png""/></a>\n<a href=""https://twitter.com/hhsgov"" target=""_parent"" title=""Visit the HHS Twitter account""><img alt=""Visit the HHS Twitter account"" src=""/sites/all/themes/project_h/css/images/twitter-icon-32x32.png""/></a>\n<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/hhsgov/"" target=""_parent"" title=""Visit the HHS Instagram account""><img alt=""Visit the HHS Instagram account"" src=""/sites/all/themes/project_h/css/images/instagram-icon-32x32.png""/></a>\n</p> <p>\n<a addthis:userid=""USGOVHHS"" alt=""Visit the HHS YouTube account"" class=""addthis_button_youtube_follow"" target=""_parent"" title=""Visit the HHS YouTube account""><img alt=""Visit the HHS YouTube account"" src=""/sites/all/themes/project_h/css/images/youtube-icon-32x32.png""/></a>\n<a addthis:userid=""hhsgov/"" alt=""Visit the HHS Flickr account"" class=""addthis_button_flickr_follow"" target=""_parent"" title=""Visit the HHS Flickr account""><img alt=""Visit the HHS Flickr account"" src=""/sites/all/themes/project_h/css/images/flickr-icon-32x32.png""/></a>\n<a addthis:userid=""us-department-of-health-and-human-services/"" addthis:usertype=""company"" alt=""Visit the HHS LinkedIn account"" class=""addthis_button_linkedin_follow"" target=""_parent"" title=""Visit the HHS LinkedIn account""><img alt=""Visit the HHS LinkedIn account"" src=""/sites/all/themes/project_h/css/images/linkedin-icon-32x32.png""/></a>\n<!-- <a class=""addthis_button_pinterest_follow"" addthis:userid=""hhsgov/"" title=""Visit the HHS Pinterest account"" alt=""Visit the HHS Pinterest account"" target=""_parent""><img src=""/sites/all/themes/project_h/css/images/footer-pinterest.png"" alt=""Visit the HHS Pinterest account"" /></a> -->\n<!-- <a href=""https://plus.google.com/+HHS/posts"" title=""Visit HHS GooglePlus account"" target=""_parent""><img src=""/sites/all/themes/project_h/css/images/footer-googleplus.png"" alt=""Visit HHS GooglePlus account"" /></a> -->\n</p> <p>To sign up for updates or to access your subscriber preferences please enter your contact information below.</p> <p>U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services<br/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t200 Independence Avenue S.W.<br/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWashington D.C. 20201<br/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tToll Free Call Center: 1-877-696-6775\u200b</p>]",[Home &gt; About &gt; News &gt; Surgeon General releases advisory on E-cigarette epidemic among youth U.S. Surgeon General Vice Adm.

Secretary Azar delivered the following remarks at the plenary session on antimicrobial resistance (AMR):</p> <p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">\u201cThank you Argentina and Minister Rubinstein for your leadership of this important meeting and for your hospitality. The United States is committed to engaging on the issue of antimicrobial resistance and considers it a top priority for global health engagement and hope G20 countries will continue to advocate for high level focus on AMR at the World Health Organization and other One Health multilateral organizations. \xa0First we believe that it is productive to consider the role that the private sector can play in addressing this challenge.</p> <p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">\u201cThere is no doubt that more must be done to incentivize increased R&amp;D for new antibiotics and diagnostics. Governments must work with companies and not against them to encourage innovation in this space\u2026Our health department and the whole U.S. government strongly believe in following the best science we have in formulating policies on issues like AMR. Often the science points to very specific interventions that target certain antimicrobials certain pathogens and certain uses rather than blanket rules or arbitrary thresholds\u2026The United States has made and is making great strides in improved stewardship of the use of antimicrobials: In the agricultural sector our government has worked collaboratively with our industries to remove any use of antibiotics for growth promotion and to provide greater oversight over the use of antibiotics for treating diseases in livestock\u2026A One Health approach to AMR that incorporates this work is important. It helps us to gain a better understanding of where and how resistance arises and to better confront the transfer of resistance across human health agriculture and environment sectors\u2026.In the human health sector we are undertaking initiatives to better educate providers and patients on the prudent uses of antibiotics and to encourage more in-depth consideration of how and when to use antibiotics in hospital settings\u2026\u201d</p> <p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">\u201cA further challenge is substandard or falsified SF antibiotics which greatly increase the risk of resistance due to decreased effectiveness of the drugs and the uncertainty of proper dosing. At this year\u2019s meeting the U.S. would like to encourage a special focus on this issue which is also a key part of health systems strengthening. When SF medicines do not work as expected when compared with genuine medicines the health of patients suffers and they lose confidence in the healthcare system. The issue of SF medicines is also relevant to this year\u2019s third G20 issue pandemic preparedness and global health security where the reliable efficacy of medical countermeasures is critical to controlling major outbreaks.\u201d</p> <p>And on the topic of strengthening health systems Secretary Azar said:</p> <p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">\u201cThe United States strongly supports efforts to strengthen health security and believes that action by the G20 is important to improve preparedness across all regions. One crucial aspect of effective pandemic preparedness is building resilient health systems.</p> <p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">\u201cAn important tool in this effort is transparency. External evaluations utilizing broad expertise can help identify gaps in preparedness and published national action plans can help potential donors see opportunities for collaboration. Multi-sectoral partnerships and cross-sectoral coordination especially engaging the private sector are critical to fill in the identified gaps in our systems\u2019 capacities to prevent detect and respond to infectious disease threats\u2026.in the United States we are now working to advance our health system from one that pays for procedures and sickness to one that pays for outcomes and health\u2014in other words a value-based system.</p> <p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">\u201cHealth system transformation to people-centered and value based health care should be tailored to the needs of the local contexts and allow for a basket of options to enable the broadest access to care. Nearly all healthcare delivery systems utilize a range of resources including from non-governmental sources to provide the most effective care for their citizens. In the United States in particular we provide broad access to very high quality care by engaging the private sector both private systems and community- and faith-based groups. .. We do believe that there is value in the extensive research and findings of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development on healthcare systems and care delivery. As the G20 we could be leveraging their work to assist countries at different stages in the improvement of their healthcare systems.</p> <p>Next Secretary Azar delivered the following remarks at the plenary session on childhood obesity:</p> <p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">\u201cWe all recognize the burgeoning problem of childhood obesity around the world. These challenges demand a comprehensive and cooperative strategy. Examples of successful voluntary collaborations with private-sector companies to address obesity and its related diseases abound in many countries around the world. In the U.S. for example the Healthy Weight Commitment Foundation\u2019s Trillion Calorie Pledge was a voluntary ingredient reformulation initiative launched in 2010 by 16 of the nation\u2019s leading food and beverage companies. The aim was to reduce 1 trillion cumulative calories from U.S. diets by 2012 and 1.5 trillion calories by 2015. The initiative actually led to reducing 6.4 trillion calories\u2014400 percent more than the pledged amount. Governments also can collaborate with companies on initiatives to better inform consumers about nutrition and healthy diets empowering consumers to take control of tackling obesity at the individual level. Voluntary food packaging information or school- and community-based educational initiatives can go a long way towards enabling and encouraging healthy behaviors. Responding to it effectively however demands the kind of innovation and commitment that can only come from engaging the private sector communities families and individuals themselves. When our countries do that effectively we believe we can finally make lasting progress on this challenge.\u201d</p> <p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">\u201cA problem this significant and complex also does not have a single solution and must be tackled by all sectors. Childhood obesity is a challenge just about everywhere but approaches to addressing it must be tailored to national contexts and driven by national initiatives. What works for one country will not always work in another. In fact the issue can even be differentiated across regions within a country\u2014within the United States different areas have different challenges. For these reasons local community and regional initiatives often are the most effective ways to approach the issue. Complex issues like food systems do not lend themselves to an easy one-size-fits-all approach.\xa0 Rather they demand a comprehensive and cooperative strategy\u2026Responding to it effectively however demands the kind of innovation and commitment that can only come from engaging the private sector communities families and individuals themselves. When our countries do that effectively we believe we can finally make lasting progress on this challenge.\u201d</p> <p>In the afternoon Secretary Azar participated in the One Health AMR Simulation Exercise. The purpose of this targeted exercise was to raise awareness and understanding of the key challenges raised by AMR across a variety of sectors.</p> <p>Throughout the day Secretary Azar attended bilateral meetings with Dr. Thomas Gebhart the Parliamentary State Secretary to the Federal Ministry of Health of Germany; Gan Kim Yong the Health Minister of the Republic of Singapore; Bruno Bruins the Minister for Medical Care and Sport of the Netherlands; and Steve Brine the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Public Health and Primary Care of the United Kingdom.

Azar today declared a public health emergency in Virginia to prepare for potential impacts of Hurricane Florence. The declaration follows President Trump\u2019s emergency declaration for the state and gives Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services\u2019 (CMS) beneficiaries and their healthcare providers and suppliers greater flexibility in meeting emergency health needs. \u201cAs the President has emphasized we are fully prepared to support communities that need our help because of the storm\u201d Secretary Azar said. \u201cWe are working closely with state health and emergency management officials to anticipate communities\u2019 needs and be ready to meet them.\u201d \xa0Secretary Azar acted under his authority in the Public Health Service Act and Social Security Act in declaring the public health emergency in Virginia and authorizing flexibilities to support CMS beneficiaries. These actions and flexibilities are retroactive to Sept. 8 2018. In addition to making this declaration HHS worked with FEMA to pre-position approximately 400 medical and public health personnel from the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps the National Disaster Medical System and across the department along with caches of medical equipment for HHS medical teams so that they are readily available immediately after the storm. Approximately 150 additional HHS health responders are on alert to deploy if needed. Approximately 300 ambulances are standing ready to assist with patient care transport and evacuation. Two 250-bed Federal Medical Stations are staged to support care for displaced people with special health needs including those with chronic health conditions limited mobility or common mental health issues. The HHS Office of Civil Rights issued guidance to state and local agencies and community organizations to help ensure equal access to emergency services and the appropriate sharing of medical information during Hurricane Florence including how federal civil rights laws apply in an emergency how HIPAA laws apply in an emergency. OCR also provided a HIPAA Disclosures for Emergency Preparedness Decision Tool. The HHS Secretary\u2019s Operation Center managed by the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) remains activated 24/7 to coordinate federal public health and medical support bringing to bear the federal government\u2019s full range of health-related assets and resources. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also activated their emergency operations centers to support the Secretary\u2019s Operations Center and to coordinate hurricane response activities across their divisions and with their state and private sector partners. ASPR and CMS collaborated to provide information to state health officials in South Carolina North Carolina and Virginia on the number of Medicare beneficiaries who rely on dialysis or on special medical equipment at home and the type of equipment such as oxygen concentrators in the potentially impacted areas. This information assists health and emergency management agencies in saving lives particularly after extended power outages. HHS divisions continue to work with state and private sector contacts to prepare for the storm. FDA for example is prepared to assist manufacturing firms in the hurricane\u2019s projected path if needed after the storm. Potential flooding is one of the greatest concerns for manufacturing facilities. To learn more about how to prepare and for health safety information visit the HHS emergency website.

Additionally the report shows that the departments\u2019 FY 2017 Takedown event was the single largest healthcare fraud enforcement operation in history.</p> <p>In FY 2017 the government\u2019s healthcare fraud prevention and enforcement efforts recovered $2.6 billion in taxpayer dollars from individuals and entities attempting to defraud the federal government and Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. Some of these fraudulent practices include:</p> <p>\u201cToday\u2019s report highlights the success of HHS and DOJ\u2019s joint fraud-fighting efforts\u201d said HHS Secretary Azar. \u201cBy holding individuals and entities accountable for defrauding our federal health programs we are protecting the programs\u2019 beneficiaries safeguarding billions in taxpayer dollars and in the case of pill mills helping stem the tide of our nation\u2019s opioid epidemic.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTaxpayers work hard every day to help fund government programs for our fellow Americans\u201d Attorney General Sessions said. \u201cBut too many trusted medical professionals like doctors nurses and pharmacists have chosen to violate their oaths and exploit this generosity to line their pockets sometimes for millions of dollars.\xa0 At the Department of Justice we have taken historic new actions to incarcerate these criminals and recover stolen funds including executing the largest healthcare fraud enforcement action in American history.\xa0 These achievements are important but the department's work is not finished. We will keep up this pace and continue to prosecute fraudsters so that we can give financial relief to taxpayers.\u201d</p> <p>The departments of Justice (DOJ) and Health and Human Services (HHS) through the Health Care Fraud Prevention and Enforcement Action Team (HEAT) effort use data analytics and surveillance to crack down on prevent and prosecute healthcare fraud. While the program continues to be very successful the return on investment fluctuates from year to year in part because cases resulting in large settlements take multiple years to complete. Additionally there has been a reduction in large monetary settlements as many of the large pharmaceutical manufacturers have entered into Corporate Integrity Agreements with the HHS Office of the Inspector General to establish protections against fraudulent activities.</p> <p>With teams comprised of law enforcement agents prosecutors attorneys auditors evaluators and other staff last year DOJ opened 967 new criminal healthcare fraud investigations of which federal prosecutors filed criminal charges in 439 cases involving 720 defendants.\xa0 A total of 639 defendants were convicted of healthcare fraud related crimes. In FY 2017 the DOJ and HHS joint Medicare Fraud Strike Force filed 253 indictments and charges against 478 defendants who allegedly billed federal healthcare programs more than $2.3 billion. The Strike Force obtained more than 290 guilty pleas litigated 33 jury trials and won guilty verdicts against 40 defendants. The Fraud Strike Force secured prison sentences for more than 300 defendants with an average sentence of 50 months. Since its inception in 2007 Strike Force prosecutors filed more than 1660 cases charging more than 3490 defendants who collectively billed the Medicare program more than $13 billion.</p> <p>Beyond criminal prosecution the HHS Office of Inspector General (OIG) remains vigilant in excluding providers and suppliers who committed fraud or engaged in the abuse or neglect of patients in federal health programs. A total of 3244 individuals and entities were excluded in FY 2017.\xa0Others were excluded as a result of licensure revocations. These exclusions help to safeguard beneficiaries from future harm that could otherwise be inflicted by such convicted individuals or entities.

Additionally the report shows that the departments\u2019 FY 2017 Takedown event was the single largest healthcare fraud enforcement operation in history. In FY 2017 the government\u2019s healthcare fraud prevention and enforcement efforts recovered $2.6 billion in taxpayer dollars from individuals and entities attempting to defraud the federal government and Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. Some of these fraudulent practices include: \u201cToday\u2019s report highlights the success of HHS and DOJ\u2019s joint fraud-fighting efforts\u201d said HHS Secretary Azar. \u201cBy holding individuals and entities accountable for defrauding our federal health programs we are protecting the programs\u2019 beneficiaries safeguarding billions in taxpayer dollars and in the case of pill mills helping stem the tide of our nation\u2019s opioid epidemic.\u201d \u201cTaxpayers work hard every day to help fund government programs for our fellow Americans\u201d Attorney General Sessions said. \u201cBut too many trusted medical professionals like doctors nurses and pharmacists have chosen to violate their oaths and exploit this generosity to line their pockets sometimes for millions of dollars.\xa0 At the Department of Justice we have taken historic new actions to incarcerate these criminals and recover stolen funds including executing the largest healthcare fraud enforcement action in American history.\xa0 These achievements are important but the department's work is not finished. We will keep up this pace and continue to prosecute fraudsters so that we can give financial relief to taxpayers.\u201d The departments of Justice (DOJ) and Health and Human Services (HHS) through the Health Care Fraud Prevention and Enforcement Action Team (HEAT) effort use data analytics and surveillance to crack down on prevent and prosecute healthcare fraud. While the program continues to be very successful the return on investment fluctuates from year to year in part because cases resulting in large settlements take multiple years to complete. Additionally there has been a reduction in large monetary settlements as many of the large pharmaceutical manufacturers have entered into Corporate Integrity Agreements with the HHS Office of the Inspector General to establish protections against fraudulent activities. With teams comprised of law enforcement agents prosecutors attorneys auditors evaluators and other staff last year DOJ opened 967 new criminal healthcare fraud investigations of which federal prosecutors filed criminal charges in 439 cases involving 720 defendants.\xa0 A total of 639 defendants were convicted of healthcare fraud related crimes. In FY 2017 the DOJ and HHS joint Medicare Fraud Strike Force filed 253 indictments and charges against 478 defendants who allegedly billed federal healthcare programs more than $2.3 billion. The Strike Force obtained more than 290 guilty pleas litigated 33 jury trials and won guilty verdicts against 40 defendants. The Fraud Strike Force secured prison sentences for more than 300 defendants with an average sentence of 50 months. Since its inception in 2007 Strike Force prosecutors filed more than 1660 cases charging more than 3490 defendants who collectively billed the Medicare program more than $13 billion. Beyond criminal prosecution the HHS Office of Inspector General (OIG) remains vigilant in excluding providers and suppliers who committed fraud or engaged in the abuse or neglect of patients in federal health programs. A total of 3244 individuals and entities were excluded in FY 2017.\xa0Others were excluded as a result of licensure revocations. These exclusions help to safeguard beneficiaries from future harm that could otherwise be inflicted by such convicted individuals or entities. HHS can also suspend Medicare payments to providers during investigations of credible allegations of fraud.\xa0 During FY 2017 there were 551 related payment suspensions.\xa0 More than 4 million claims are reviewed by Medicare each day; resulting in more than one billion claims processed annually for timely payments to healthcare providers and suppliers. Given the volume of claims processed by Medicare each day and the significant cost associated with conducting medical review of an individual claim the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services uses automated edits to help prevent improper payments without the need for manual intervention.\xa0 The National Correct Coding Initiative consists of edits designed to reduce improper payments in Medicare Part B and this program saved Medicare $186.9 million during the first nine months of FY 2017.

The declaration triggers other legal authorities that give the HHS Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) beneficiaries their healthcare providers and suppliers greater flexibility in meeting emergency health needs in the aftermath of the earthquake. \u201cHHS is working closely with state health authorities and monitoring the needs of healthcare facilities\u201d Secretary Azar said. \u201cThis declaration will help ensure that Americans who were affected by the earthquake and rely on Medicare Medicaid and the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program have continuous access to the care as the area recovers.\u201d With the declaration in place CMS can use legal authority provided under the Social Security Act section 1135 to grant waivers that will aid healthcare facilities in providing uninterrupted care and services for the elderly and people with disabilities living in long-term care facilities. The waivers also support the Alaska Medicaid Agency\u2019s administrative processes ensuring that Medicaid funds continue to flow despite the temporary closure of the agency\u2019s offices. As part of the federal response to the earthquake the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration\u2019s Disaster Distress Helpline is available to assist residents in the impacted areas in coping with the stress of the disaster. The Disaster Distress Helpline provides immediate 24/7 365-days-a-year crisis counseling and support to people experiencing emotional distress related to natural or human-caused disasters. This toll-free multilingual and confidential crisis support service is available to all residents in the United States and its territories. Stress anxiety and other depression-like symptoms are common reactions in disasters. Call 1-800-985-5990 toll free or text TalkWithUs to 66746 to connect with a trained crisis counselor.

57,https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2018/08/07/trump-administration-gives-medicare-new-tools-to-negotiate-lower-drug-prices-for-patients.html,"[<p class=""breadcrumb""><a href=""/"">Home</a> &gt; <a href=""/about"">About</a> &gt; <a href=""/about/news"">News</a> &gt; Trump Administration Gives Medicare New Tools to Negotiate Lower Drug Prices for Patients</p> <p>Today delivering on proposals in President Trump\u2019s American Patients First blueprint HHS announced that Medicare Advantage plans will be able to use tools employed by private-sector insurers to negotiate lower prescription drug prices for patients.</p> <p>HHS Secretary Alex Azar issued the following statement:</p> <p>\u201cPresident Trump promised better Medicare negotiation and lower drug prices for the American people. Today we are taking an important step in delivering on that promise. By allowing Medicare Advantage plans to negotiate for physician-administered drugs like private-sector insurers already do we can drive down prices for some of the most expensive drugs seniors use.</p> <p>\u201cAs soon as next year drug prices can start coming down for many of the 20 million seniors on Medicare Advantage with more than half of the savings going to patients. Consumers will always retain the power to choose the plan that works for them: If they don\u2019t like their plan they don\u2019t have to keep it.</p> <p>\u201cWe look forward to seeing the results of this step toward tougher negotiation within Medicare and will continue efforts to expand negotiation tools throughout our programs.\u201d</p> <p align=""center""><strong><em>Further Background</em></strong></p> <p><strong>What is the policy HHS announced today?</strong></p> <p>The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services is rescinding a policy regarding Medicare Part B drugs that discouraged Medicare Advantage plans from using tools that are widely used in private insurance plans to negotiate lower prices from pharmaceutical companies.</p> <p>Specifically patients will now be able to choose Medicare Advantage plans that require enrollees to try certain more cost-effective drugs first (known as \u201cstep therapy\u201d). Plans will also be able to cross-manage between the drugs covered by different parts of Medicare allowing them to pay for the most appropriate most affordable drugs regardless of whether patients receive them in a doctor\u2019s office (Part B) or at a pharmacy (Part D).</p> <p>These negotiating tools will offer plans the same power that private-sector insurers have to drive down the price of prescription drugs and force manufacturers to compete on price while maintaining patients\u2019 rights to appeal decisions choose another plan or enroll in Medicare fee-for-service instead.</p> <p><strong>What is the problem that\u2019s being addressed?</strong></p> <p>As President Trump has made clear American drug prices are too high. Government programs for our seniors often pay higher prices than necessary for drugs because they lack the tools they need to negotiate discounts. For many physician-administered drugs covered by Medicare Part B private insurance plans negotiate discounts of 15 to 20 percent or more while Medicare essentially pays full price.</p> <p>This step to strengthen negotiation in Medicare is one piece of HHS\u2019s ongoing efforts to implement the President\u2019s <a data-vars-download-link=""https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/AmericanPatientsFirst.pdf"" href=""/sites/default/files/AmericanPatientsFirst.pdf"">American Patients First blueprint</a>. As Secretary Azar said in introducing the blueprint at the White House in May \u201cOur blueprint brings the latest negotiation tools to our government programs and expands private-sector negotiation to parts of Medicare that have never had negotiation.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Who will benefit from this change?</strong></p> <p>More than 20 million Americans are enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans representing 33 percent of Medicare enrollees. In 2017 Medicare Advantage plans spent $11.9 billion on Medicare Part B drugs the category where plans will now have more power to drive down prices.</p> <p><strong>How will patients see the benefit of these savings?</strong></p> <p>Plans will be required to pass on to patients more than half of the savings generated from tougher negotiation. Savings can be realized for enrollees through lower coinsurance amounts and through rewards programs which provide patients with benefits such as gift cards.</p> <p>Beginning in 2020 plans will be able to pass on savings to patients through lower premiums. (Premiums have already been set for 2019 Medicare Advantage plans.)</p> <p><strong>How soon can patients see savings?</strong></p> <p>Medicare Advantage plans can begin using these tools as part of their 2019 policies meaning savings could be generated and passed on to patients as soon as next year. Plans have limited time to implement the tools for next year however and it is expected that more plans will adopt the tools over time.</p> <p><strong>How will this protect patients\u2019 access to drugs?</strong></p> <p>High drug prices and the associated cost-sharing can be a significant barrier to patients\u2019 access to drugs which is why President Trump has made bringing down prices such a priority.</p> <p>Each year beneficiaries have the opportunity to choose which Medicare Advantage plan is right for them or whether they would prefer Medicare fee-for-service which covers all medically necessary drugs at a fixed price. Plans will be allowed only to apply step therapy to new prescriptions or prescriptions where the patient is not actively receiving the affected medication.

HHS Secretary Alex Azar issued the following statement: \u201cPresident Trump promised better Medicare negotiation and lower drug prices for the American people. Today we are taking an important step in delivering on that promise. By allowing Medicare Advantage plans to negotiate for physician-administered drugs like private-sector insurers already do we can drive down prices for some of the most expensive drugs seniors use. \u201cAs soon as next year drug prices can start coming down for many of the 20 million seniors on Medicare Advantage with more than half of the savings going to patients. Consumers will always retain the power to choose the plan that works for them: If they don\u2019t like their plan they don\u2019t have to keep it. \u201cWe look forward to seeing the results of this step toward tougher negotiation within Medicare and will continue efforts to expand negotiation tools throughout our programs.\u201d Further Background What is the policy HHS announced today? The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services is rescinding a policy regarding Medicare Part B drugs that discouraged Medicare Advantage plans from using tools that are widely used in private insurance plans to negotiate lower prices from pharmaceutical companies. Specifically patients will now be able to choose Medicare Advantage plans that require enrollees to try certain more cost-effective drugs first (known as \u201cstep therapy\u201d). Plans will also be able to cross-manage between the drugs covered by different parts of Medicare allowing them to pay for the most appropriate most affordable drugs regardless of whether patients receive them in a doctor\u2019s office (Part B) or at a pharmacy (Part D). These negotiating tools will offer plans the same power that private-sector insurers have to drive down the price of prescription drugs and force manufacturers to compete on price while maintaining patients\u2019 rights to appeal decisions choose another plan or enroll in Medicare fee-for-service instead. What is the problem that\u2019s being addressed? As President Trump has made clear American drug prices are too high. Government programs for our seniors often pay higher prices than necessary for drugs because they lack the tools they need to negotiate discounts. For many physician-administered drugs covered by Medicare Part B private insurance plans negotiate discounts of 15 to 20 percent or more while Medicare essentially pays full price. This step to strengthen negotiation in Medicare is one piece of HHS\u2019s ongoing efforts to implement the President\u2019s American Patients First blueprint. As Secretary Azar said in introducing the blueprint at the White House in May \u201cOur blueprint brings the latest negotiation tools to our government programs and expands private-sector negotiation to parts of Medicare that have never had negotiation.\u201d Who will benefit from this change? More than 20 million Americans are enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans representing 33 percent of Medicare enrollees. In 2017 Medicare Advantage plans spent $11.9 billion on Medicare Part B drugs the category where plans will now have more power to drive down prices. How will patients see the benefit of these savings? Plans will be required to pass on to patients more than half of the savings generated from tougher negotiation. Savings can be realized for enrollees through lower coinsurance amounts and through rewards programs which provide patients with benefits such as gift cards. Beginning in 2020 plans will be able to pass on savings to patients through lower premiums. (Premiums have already been set for 2019 Medicare Advantage plans.) How soon can patients see savings? Medicare Advantage plans can begin using these tools as part of their 2019 policies meaning savings could be generated and passed on to patients as soon as next year. Plans have limited time to implement the tools for next year however and it is expected that more plans will adopt the tools over time. How will this protect patients\u2019 access to drugs? High drug prices and the associated cost-sharing can be a significant barrier to patients\u2019 access to drugs which is why President Trump has made bringing down prices such a priority. Each year beneficiaries have the opportunity to choose which Medicare Advantage plan is right for them or whether they would prefer Medicare fee-for-service which covers all medically necessary drugs at a fixed price. Plans will be allowed only to apply step therapy to new prescriptions or prescriptions where the patient is not actively receiving the affected medication. On top of that for the first time in 2019 beneficiaries will be able to change their Medicare Advantage plan or switch to fee-for-service through March 31. If a beneficiary chooses a plan that incorporates step therapy and needs a drug subject to it but feels they need access to it without trying an alternative drug they can ask their plan for an exception which will be reviewed as expeditiously as the beneficiary\u2019s health condition requires (generally within 72 hours). Medicare Advantage plans will be required to couple Part B step therapy with patient-centered care coordination services for beneficiaries as part of a drug management care coordination program. Care coordination must include discussing medication options with beneficiaries providing beneficiaries with educational material and information about their medications and implementing adherence strategies to their medication regimen. How does this fit into President Trump\u2019s drug-pricing blueprint? President Trump and Secretary Azar laid out tougher negotiation as one of the four key strategies for putting American patients first and lowering drug prices. In particular the blueprint highlighted the importance of bringing competition to Medicare Part B which CMS is doing today.\n\tThis policy change to Medicare Advantage will bring new negotiating power to Medicare faster than other policies may have but it is just part of a broader vision to ensure that the latest successful negotiation tools are applied throughout the Medicare program to bring down prices for seniors.

62,https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2018/07/19/hhs-secretary-azar-directs-fda-establish-working-group-drug-importation-address-price-spikes.html,"[<p class=""breadcrumb""><a href=""/"">Home</a> &gt; <a href=""/about"">About</a> &gt; <a href=""/about/news"">News</a> &gt; HHS Secretary Azar Directs FDA to Establish Working Group on Drug Importation to Address Price Spikes</p> <p>As part of the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to lower drug prices and put American patients first Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar requested today that FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb establish a working group to examine how to safely import prescription drugs from other countries in the event of a dramatic price increase for a drug produced by one manufacturer and not protected by patents or exclusivities.</p> <p>\u201cWe look forward to working with Commissioner Gottlieb and the FDA to explore how importation could help address price hikes and supply disruptions that are harming American patients\u201d said Secretary Azar. \u201cWe have seen a number of both branded and generic examples in recent years where a single manufacturer dramatically hikes the price for a drug unprotected by patent or exclusivities. In the 2015 case of the drug Daraprim we saw the list price of a drug approved by the FDA in 1953 increase by more than 5000 percent.</p> <p>\u201cSafe select avenues for importation could be one of the answers to these challenges. When HHS released the President\u2019s Blueprint for putting American patients first I said we are open to all potential solutions\u2014assuming they are effective safe for patients and respect choice innovation and access.</p> <p>\u201cImportation may well fit that bill in some instances. We look forward to working with Commissioner Gottlieb on this issue and appreciate the voluminous work FDA has done to increase competition in America\u2019s drug markets.\u201d</p> <p><em>Further Background</em></p> <p><strong>Why is the Trump administration launching this working group?</strong></p> <p>President Trump and Secretary Azar have consistently maintained that HHS is willing to explore <u>all</u> ways to tackle the soaring price of drugs while protecting incentives for innovation and maintaining standards of patient safety and access. The working group will examine importation of drugs that have seen significant price increases or significant access challenges for patients.</p> <p><strong>How does this compare with other importation proposals?</strong></p> <p>This working group will examine the potential to promote competition for drugs that are off-patent or off-exclusivity and produced by one manufacturer. This stands in contrast to proposals to import a broader range of drugs which raise additional questions about how to protect American patients.</p> <p>The working group will consider drugs unprotected by patents or exclusivities which will allow other manufacturers to introduce new competition.</p> <p>Because the drugs being considered for importation are off-patent and have no exclusivity remaining the proposals contemplated by the working group would not dilute intellectual property rights or affect incentives for innovation. Rather they would provide a new avenue for competition to drive down prices for American patients.</p> <p><strong>Is safe importation possible?</strong></p> <p>The Food and Drug Administration\u2019s gold standard for safety and effectiveness is unimpeachable and will guide the working group\u2019s efforts.

In the 2015 case of the drug Daraprim we saw the list price of a drug approved by the FDA in 1953 increase by more than 5000 percent. \u201cSafe select avenues for importation could be one of the answers to these challenges. When HHS released the President\u2019s Blueprint for putting American patients first I said we are open to all potential solutions\u2014assuming they are effective safe for patients and respect choice innovation and access. \u201cImportation may well fit that bill in some instances. We look forward to working with Commissioner Gottlieb on this issue and appreciate the voluminous work FDA has done to increase competition in America\u2019s drug markets.\u201d Further Background Why is the Trump administration launching this working group? President Trump and Secretary Azar have consistently maintained that HHS is willing to explore all ways to tackle the soaring price of drugs while protecting incentives for innovation and maintaining standards of patient safety and access. The working group will examine importation of drugs that have seen significant price increases or significant access challenges for patients. How does this compare with other importation proposals? This working group will examine the potential to promote competition for drugs that are off-patent or off-exclusivity and produced by one manufacturer. This stands in contrast to proposals to import a broader range of drugs which raise additional questions about how to protect American patients. The working group will consider drugs unprotected by patents or exclusivities which will allow other manufacturers to introduce new competition. Because the drugs being considered for importation are off-patent and have no exclusivity remaining the proposals contemplated by the working group would not dilute intellectual property rights or affect incentives for innovation. Rather they would provide a new avenue for competition to drive down prices for American patients. Is safe importation possible? The Food and Drug Administration\u2019s gold standard for safety and effectiveness is unimpeachable and will guide the working group\u2019s efforts. Importation will be limited to cases where drugs can be imported with adequate assurances of safety and effectiveness. Putting American patients first as President Trump aims to do means not just delivering lower prices but also ensuring that all Americans can expect that the drugs they purchase are safe and effective. Haven\u2019t administrations traditionally rejected proposals like this? President Trump has called for action on drug prices and HHS under Secretary Azar has answered with aggressive legislative proposals and sweeping potential regulatory reforms of drug pricing. The Secretary remains committed to receiving input from stakeholders and will continue to implement the President\u2019s American Patients First Blueprint.

HHS awards $293 million to expand primary health care workforce Today the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) announced $293 million in awards to primary health care clinicians and students through the National Health Service Corps (NHSC) and Nurse Corps programs. \u201cThese programs connect primary care providers with the rural urban and tribal communities across the country that need them most\u201d said HRSA Administrator George Sigounas MS Ph.D. \u201cIn addition to providing essential medical and dental care these clinicians are on the front lines helping to fight pressing public health issues like the growing opioid epidemic.\u201d The NHSC and Nurse Corps programs build healthy communities by providing scholarships and loan repayment to health care providers in exchange for working in areas of the U.S. with limited access to care. Currently an estimated 13 million patients receive care from more than 12500 NHSC and Nurse Corps clinicians. Another 1725 primary care students are either in school or in residency preparing for future service with the Corps programs. More than 3600 of these NHSC members are currently providing behavioral health care services including medication-assisted treatment and other evidence-based substance use disorder care in high-need areas. HRSA continues to invest in expanding access to substance use disorder treatment in rural and underserved areas. \u201cFor decades NHSC and Nurse Corps clinicians have been caring for vulnerable patients who might otherwise go without treatment\u201d said HRSA\u2019s Associate Administrator for Health Workforce Luis Padilla M.D. \u201cIn the midst of the current opioid crisis these providers are again rising to the challenge working in hard-hit communities to provide mental and behavioral health services including substance use disorder treatment.\u201d\xa0 HHS awards support the following programs: National Health Service Corps Scholarship Program ($47.1 million) provides 222 new awards and 7 continuation awards to students pursuing primary care training leading to a degree in medicine dentistry or a degree as a nurse-midwife physician assistant or nurse practitioner in exchange for providing primary health care services in areas of greatest need.

National Health Service Corps State Loan Repayment Program ($12.6 million) provides cost-sharing grants to 37 states and territories that operate their own loan repayment programs funding 1350 new and continuation awards. Nurse Corps Scholarship Program ($25.1 million) provides 215 new awards and 4 continuation awards to nursing students in exchange for a commitment to work at least two years in a facility with critical shortages. Nurse Corps Loan Repayment Program ($44.4 million) provides 544 new awards and 279 one-year continuation awards to nurses in exchange for a commitment to serve at a health care facility with a critical shortage of nurses or serve as nurse faculty at an accredited school of nursing.

SERVICES</strong></p> <p align=""center""><strong>U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY</strong></p> <p align=""center""><strong>U.S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR</strong></p> <p align=""left"">The President<br/>\n\t\tThe White House<br/>\n\t\tWashington DC 20500</p> <p>Dear Mr. President:</p> <p>On October 12 2017 through Executive Order 13813 you directed the Administration to the extent consistent with the law to facilitate the development and operation of a health care system that provides high-quality care at affordable prices for the American people by promoting choice and competition. \xa0We are pleased to provide you with this report prepared by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in collaboration with the Departments of the Treasury and Labor the Federal Trade Commission and several offices within the White House. \xa0This report describes the influence of state and federal laws regulations guidance and polices on choice and competition in health care markets and identifies actions that states or the Federal Government could take to develop a better functioning health care market.</p> <p>As health care spending continues to rise Americans are not receiving the commensurate benefit of living longer healthier lives. \xa0Health care bills are too complex choices are too restrained and insurance premiums and out-of-pocket costs are climbing faster than wages and tax revenue.\xa0 Health care markets could work more efficiently and Americans could receive more effective high-value care if we remove and revise certain federal and state regulations and policies that inhibit choice and competition.</p> <p>The Administration has already taken significant steps to improve health care markets by addressing government rules and programs that limit choice and competition and produce higher prices for the American people.\xa0 Among the most significant actions:</p> <p>While the Administration has made much progress in reforming the American health care system significant obstacles remain.\xa0 This report identifies four areas where federal and state rules inhibit adequate choice and competition and offers recommendations for improving public policy in each of these four areas.</p> <p><strong>Health Care Workforce and Labor Markets:</strong> \xa0Reduced competition among clinicians leads to higher prices for health care services reduces choice and negatively impacts overall health care quality and the efficient allocation of resources.\xa0 Government policies have suppressed competition by reducing the available supply of providers and restricting the range of services that they can offer.\xa0 This report recommends policies that will broaden providers\u2019 scope of practice while improving workforce mobility including telehealth to encourage innovation and to allow providers more easily to meet patients\u2019 needs.\xa0 The report also recommends that the Federal Government streamline funding for graduate medical education to allocate taxpayer dollars efficiently and to address physician supply shortages.</p> <p><strong>Health Care Provider Markets:</strong> \xa0State policies that restrict entry into provider markets can stifle innovative and more cost-effective ways to provide care while limiting choice and competition. \xa0These policies have resulted in higher health care prices and fewer incentives for providers to improve quality. \xa0This report makes several recommendations to promote choice and competition in provider markets including state action to repeal or scale back Certificate of Need laws and encourage the development of value-based payment models that offer flexibility and risk-based incentives for providers especially without unduly burdening small or rural practices.</p> <p><strong>Health Care Insurance Markets: \xa0</strong>Government mandates often reduce choice and competition in insurance markets and increase overall premiums. \xa0In the individual and small group markets many consumers face limited coverage options that cover services they do not want or need and that drive up premiums while others have been completely priced out of the market. \xa0Regulations that limit coverage choices should be changed so that states have more flexibility to develop policies that account for diverse consumer preferences.\xa0 This report recommends scaling back government mandates eliminating barriers to competition and allowing consumers maximum opportunity to purchase health insurance that meets their needs.</p> <p><strong>Consumer-Driven Health Care:\xa0 </strong>Our health care system\u2019s excessive reliance on third-party payment insulates consumers from the true price of health care and offers them little incentive to search for low-cost high-quality care.\xa0 When federal and state health policies give consumers more control over their health care dollars they can use that power to demand greater value.\xa0 For example promoting and expanding Health Saving Accounts (HSAs) and HRAs would expand personal control and introduce more consumer power into the health care market.\xa0 The report recommends expanding access to HSAs implementing reference pricing where appropriate and developing price and quality transparency initiatives to ensure that newly empowered health care consumers can make well-informed decisions about their care.</p> <p>We know the United States health care system too often fails to deliver the value it should.\xa0 This report identifies barriers on the federal and state levels to market competition that stifle innovation lead to higher prices and do not incentivize improvements in quality.\xa0 It recommends policies that will foster a health care system that delivers high-quality care at affordable prices through greater choice competition and consumer-directed health care spending.\xa0 While American consumers and many providers would significantly benefit from the reforms laid out in this report there are entrenched and powerful special interest groups that reap large profits from the status quo.\xa0 It will take bold leadership to confront these incumbents and implement reforms but under your direction we are convinced we can significantly improve the American health care system.</p> <p>We look forward to working with you as we create a more effective and efficient health care market that provides information for consumers as they make health care decisions for their families rewards quality encourages innovation and delivers care at prices the American people can afford.</p> <p>Sincerely</p> <p align=""left"">Alex M.

That\u2019s why the US government supported unanimous consensus <a class=""external-link"" data-vars-outbound-link=""http://www.who.int/nutrition/topics/wha_nutrition_iycn/en/"" href=""http://www.who.int/nutrition/topics/wha_nutrition_iycn/en/"">on the resolution on breastfeeding at the World Health Assembly</a> which plainly states that breastfeeding is optimal \u201cfor child survival nutrition and development.\u201d</p> <p>In this same resolution we urged countries to do more to promote breastfeeding and requested that the World Health Organization assist countries in mobilizing resources to support nutrition for infants and young children.</p> <p>We don\u2019t just affirm these priorities in formal conference rooms in Geneva. For years the US government under the leadership of both Republicans and Democrats has invested millions of dollars to promote breastfeeding both at home and abroad. The Trump administration continues this effort.</p> <p>We know breastfeeding helps children stay healthy. In fact America gives more than any other nation when it comes to improving nutrition globally. From 1992 to 2015 these investments have helped double exclusive breastfeeding rates in 20 countries.</p> <p>All of which is to say: Breastfeeding wasn\u2019t in dispute in Geneva. Rather we raised objections to an early draft of the resolution we eventually supported which made references to a controversial 2016 guidance document. The underlying policy goal of this guidance is unsupported by US nutrition guidelines and inconsistent with the practice of most families in our country. In 2016 the Obama administration raised the same issues about the guidance and members of Congress from both parties wrote letters to the Department of Health and Human Services expressing concerns.</p> <p>In particular the guidance recommends that countries impose stringent new regulations on the marketing of any commercially produced foods suggested for children between 6 months and 3 years old. Such restrictions in our view prevent parents from having access to all the factual information they might need. The guidance even advocates for the prohibition of free samples of formula \u2014 including in countries and conflict zones where supplies of formula could help save babies\u2019 lives.</p> <p>This administration unequivocally supports breastfeeding and our position at this year\u2019s World Health Assembly did nothing but reaffirm that. But we continued the practice of the previous administration and expressed concerns over the potentially negative public-health consequences of restricting information about safe appropriate products for children.</p> <p>Most important there are good and valid reasons both medical and personal why some mothers cannot breastfeed or choose not to breastfeed exclusively.

The administration fully endorses breastfeeding and the agencies where we work \u2014 Health and Human Services and USAID \u2014 communicate this unequivocally. That\u2019s why the US government supported unanimous consensus on the resolution on breastfeeding at the World Health Assembly which plainly states that breastfeeding is optimal \u201cfor child survival nutrition and development.\u201d In this same resolution we urged countries to do more to promote breastfeeding and requested that the World Health Organization assist countries in mobilizing resources to support nutrition for infants and young children. We don\u2019t just affirm these priorities in formal conference rooms in Geneva. For years the US government under the leadership of both Republicans and Democrats has invested millions of dollars to promote breastfeeding both at home and abroad. The Trump administration continues this effort. We know breastfeeding helps children stay healthy. In fact America gives more than any other nation when it comes to improving nutrition globally. From 1992 to 2015 these investments have helped double exclusive breastfeeding rates in 20 countries. All of which is to say: Breastfeeding wasn\u2019t in dispute in Geneva. Rather we raised objections to an early draft of the resolution we eventually supported which made references to a controversial 2016 guidance document. The underlying policy goal of this guidance is unsupported by US nutrition guidelines and inconsistent with the practice of most families in our country. In 2016 the Obama administration raised the same issues about the guidance and members of Congress from both parties wrote letters to the Department of Health and Human Services expressing concerns. In particular the guidance recommends that countries impose stringent new regulations on the marketing of any commercially produced foods suggested for children between 6 months and 3 years old. Such restrictions in our view prevent parents from having access to all the factual information they might need. The guidance even advocates for the prohibition of free samples of formula \u2014 including in countries and conflict zones where supplies of formula could help save babies\u2019 lives. This administration unequivocally supports breastfeeding and our position at this year\u2019s World Health Assembly did nothing but reaffirm that. But we continued the practice of the previous administration and expressed concerns over the potentially negative public-health consequences of restricting information about safe appropriate products for children. Most important there are good and valid reasons both medical and personal why some mothers cannot breastfeed or choose not to breastfeed exclusively. This is particularly true in situations where displacement other trauma or malnutrition have made it impossible for mothers to breastfeed their children and these babies\u2019 lives are at risk without formula or other nutritional supplementation. Parents in these dire situations need all the information and choices available. Further gradually introducing complementary foods after 6 months of age matches the guidance offered by the American Academy of Pediatrics. Promoting a range of food choices for young children while emphasizing the importance of breastfeeding is in other words the best medical guidance we can offer. While the US government has been disappointed by the misinformation spread about the events in Geneva there is also the opportunity for a positive outcome: The controversy has sparked an important conversation about the importance of balancing advocacy for breastfeeding with the fact that many women do need alternatives. The Trump administration stands with all mothers here and abroad and supports them in making the choices that will help their children grow up to be strong and healthy. ### To read the op-ed online please visit: https://nypost.com/2018/07/20/no-team-trump-doesnt-question-the-importance-of-breastfeeding/ Enter your email: Receive latest updates  HHS Media InformationASPA Press ContactsHHS Agency Press Contacts View all \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n To sign up for updates or to access your subscriber preferences please enter your contact information below.

77,https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2018/08/01/trump-administration-delivers-on-promise-of-more-affordable-health-insurance-options.html,"[<p class=""breadcrumb""><a href=""/"">Home</a> &gt; <a href=""/about"">About</a> &gt; <a href=""/about/news"">News</a> &gt; Trump Administration Delivers on Promise of More Affordable Health Insurance Options</p> <p>On Wednesday the departments of Health and Human Services Labor and the Treasury issued a final rule to help Americans struggling to afford health coverage find new more affordable options. The rule allows for the sale and renewal of short-term limited-duration plans that cover longer periods than the previous maximum period of less than three months. Such coverage can now cover an initial period of less than 12 months and taking into account any extensions a maximum duration of no longer than 36 months in total. This action will help increase choices for Americans faced with escalating premiums and dwindling options in the individual insurance market.</p> <p>\u201cUnder the Affordable Care Act Americans have seen insurance premiums rise and choices dwindle\u201d said Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar. \u201cPresident Trump is bringing more affordable insurance options back to the market including through allowing the renewal of short-term plans. These plans aren\u2019t for everyone but they can provide a much more affordable option for millions of the forgotten men and women left out by the current system.\u201d</p> <p>In a recent release of three reports on the current state of the individual insurance market Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) data reveal serious problems. While enrollment data show stable enrollment for subsidized exchange coverage the number of people enrolled in the individual market without subsidies declined by an alarming 20 percent nationally in 2017 while at the same time premiums rose by 21 percent. Many state markets experienced far more dramatic declines with unsubsidized enrollment dropping by more than 40 percent in six states including a 73 percent decline in Arizona.</p> <p>These troubling trends were besetting individual markets as President Trump took office which led the President to issue the executive order \u201cPromoting Healthcare Choice and Competition Across the United States\u201d in October 2017.

The rule allows for the sale and renewal of short-term limited-duration plans that cover longer periods than the previous maximum period of less than three months. Such coverage can now cover an initial period of less than 12 months and taking into account any extensions a maximum duration of no longer than 36 months in total. This action will help increase choices for Americans faced with escalating premiums and dwindling options in the individual insurance market. \u201cUnder the Affordable Care Act Americans have seen insurance premiums rise and choices dwindle\u201d said Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar. \u201cPresident Trump is bringing more affordable insurance options back to the market including through allowing the renewal of short-term plans. These plans aren\u2019t for everyone but they can provide a much more affordable option for millions of the forgotten men and women left out by the current system.\u201d In a recent release of three reports on the current state of the individual insurance market Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) data reveal serious problems. While enrollment data show stable enrollment for subsidized exchange coverage the number of people enrolled in the individual market without subsidies declined by an alarming 20 percent nationally in 2017 while at the same time premiums rose by 21 percent. Many state markets experienced far more dramatic declines with unsubsidized enrollment dropping by more than 40 percent in six states including a 73 percent decline in Arizona. These troubling trends were besetting individual markets as President Trump took office which led the President to issue the executive order \u201cPromoting Healthcare Choice and Competition Across the United States\u201d in October 2017. The executive order seeks to address the failings of the ACA which severely limited the choice of healthcare options available to many Americans and produced large premium increases in many state individual markets for health insurance. \u201cWe continue to see a crisis of affordability in the individual insurance market especially for those who don\u2019t qualify for large subsidies\u201d said CMS Administrator Seema Verma. \u201cThis final rule opens the door to new more affordable coverage options for millions of middle-class Americans who have been priced out of ACA plans.\u201d Short-term limited-duration insurance which is not required to comply with federal market requirements governing individual health insurance coverage can provide coverage for people transitioning between different coverage options such as an individual who is between jobs or a student taking time off from school as well as for middle-class families without access to subsidized ACA plans. Access to these plans has become increasingly important as premiums have escalated for individual market plans and affordable choices for individuals and families have dwindled. The average monthly premium for an individual in the fourth quarter of 2016 for a short-term limited-duration policy was approximately $124 compared with $393 for an unsubsidized individual market plan.

Repeat doses of the treatment may not always be feasible especially in a large-scale terrorist attack\u201d said Rick Bright Ph.D. director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) part of the HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response. \u201cImproved opioid exposure treatments are critical to adequately address this growing threat to public health and health security.\u201d</p> <p>BARDA will partner with Opiant to develop a new formulation of the drug called nalmefene. Synthetic opioids like fentanyl and its derivatives are now the most common cause of overdose deaths in the United States. The potential for weaponization of these agents is also a concern.</p> <p>Naloxone is the most commonly used treatment for opioid overdose in the United States.\xa0 Because of the shorter half-life of naloxone compared to fentanyl derivatives repeat dosing of naloxone often is needed to fully reverse the effects of the opioid. Longer lasting drugs can reduce the need for repeat dosing. Nalmefene acts in the same way as naloxone and studies suggest that it may work for much longer.</p> <p>Under a one-year approximately $611000 contract with BARDA Opiant will advance the development of intranasal nalmefene using a proprietary absorption enhancer to treat confirmed or suspected opioid overdoses. The contract can be extended up to a total of $4.6 million over three years for work necessary to apply for U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval.</p> <p>In addition the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) part of the National Institutes of Health provided a grant earlier this year for Opiant to perform formulation development and clinical studies for this product and funded an initial clinical study that showed the new additive given with nalmefene and administered intranasally to be as active as the injected form. BARDA and NIDA will be coordinating on the development of this treatment.</p> <p>Injection nalmefene is approved by the FDA for opioid overdoses but the drug was removed from the U.S. market in 2008 due to low sales and is no longer available.\xa0 Returning nalmefene to market in an easy-to-administer intranasal formulation may be an important addition to the nation\u2019s preparedness for current and emerging opioid threats.</p> <p>BARDA continues to seek proposals for development of effective products to treat injuries caused by chemical agents including new products or new indications for products already in clinical use. These products must be easy to use in a mass casualty situation and safe and effective for all segments of the population. Proposals are accepted through the Broad Agency Announcement BAA-18-100-SOL-00003 at the Federal Business Opportunities website <a href=""https://www.fbo.gov/"">www.fbo.gov</a>.</p> <p><strong>About HHS ASPR and BARDA</strong></p> <p>HHS works to enhance and protect the health and well-being of all Americans providing for effective health and human services and fostering advances in medicine public health and social services.

Repeat doses of the treatment may not always be feasible especially in a large-scale terrorist attack\u201d said Rick Bright Ph.D. director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) part of the HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response. \u201cImproved opioid exposure treatments are critical to adequately address this growing threat to public health and health security.\u201d BARDA will partner with Opiant to develop a new formulation of the drug called nalmefene. Synthetic opioids like fentanyl and its derivatives are now the most common cause of overdose deaths in the United States. The potential for weaponization of these agents is also a concern. Naloxone is the most commonly used treatment for opioid overdose in the United States.\xa0 Because of the shorter half-life of naloxone compared to fentanyl derivatives repeat dosing of naloxone often is needed to fully reverse the effects of the opioid. Longer lasting drugs can reduce the need for repeat dosing. Nalmefene acts in the same way as naloxone and studies suggest that it may work for much longer. Under a one-year approximately $611000 contract with BARDA Opiant will advance the development of intranasal nalmefene using a proprietary absorption enhancer to treat confirmed or suspected opioid overdoses. The contract can be extended up to a total of $4.6 million over three years for work necessary to apply for U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval. In addition the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) part of the National Institutes of Health provided a grant earlier this year for Opiant to perform formulation development and clinical studies for this product and funded an initial clinical study that showed the new additive given with nalmefene and administered intranasally to be as active as the injected form. BARDA and NIDA will be coordinating on the development of this treatment. Injection nalmefene is approved by the FDA for opioid overdoses but the drug was removed from the U.S. market in 2008 due to low sales and is no longer available.\xa0 Returning nalmefene to market in an easy-to-administer intranasal formulation may be an important addition to the nation\u2019s preparedness for current and emerging opioid threats. BARDA continues to seek proposals for development of effective products to treat injuries caused by chemical agents including new products or new indications for products already in clinical use. These products must be easy to use in a mass casualty situation and safe and effective for all segments of the population. Proposals are accepted through the Broad Agency Announcement BAA-18-100-SOL-00003 at the Federal Business Opportunities website www.fbo.gov.

Brett P. Giroir M.D. assistant secretary for health announced the release of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 second edition of the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans at the American Heart Association\u2019s Scientific Sessions meeting. The second edition provides evidence-based recommendations for youth ages 3 through 17 and adults to safely get the physical activity they need to stay healthy. There are new key guidelines for children ages 3 through 5 and updated guidelines for youth ages 6 through 17 adults older adults women during pregnancy and the postpartum period adults with chronic health conditions and adults with disabilities.</p> <p>The United States currently has low levels of adherence to the guidelines -- only 26 percent of men 19 percent of women and 20 percent of adolescents meet the recommendations. According to the guidelines these low levels of physical activity among Americans have health and economic consequences for the nation with nearly $117 billion dollars in annual healthcare costs and 10 percent of all premature mortality attributable to failure to meet levels of aerobic physical activity recommended in the guidelines. Adults need 150 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous aerobic activity each week with muscle strengthening activities on two days during the week to stay healthy. Youth ages 6 through 17 need 60 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity each day.</p> <p>\u201cThe new guidelines demonstrate that based on the best science everyone can dramatically improve their health just by moving \u2013 anytime anywhere and by any means that gets you active\u201d said Adm. Giroir. \u201cThat\u2019s why we need to come together as a nation to get Americans moving. When we move more we have better cardiovascular health we are stronger and less susceptible to disease and we feel better. The updated guidelines include evidence-based strategies that leaders across the nation can use to help Americans fit more physical activity into their daily lives.\u201d</p> <p>The second edition based on a comprehensive scientific review reflects new knowledge about immediate and long-term health benefits from physical activity as well as new evidence that physical activity can help manage chronic conditions that many Americans have.\xa0\xa0</p> <p>\u201cThe American Heart Association has long recognized physical activity as a proven way to lower chances of heart disease and live a longer healthier life. Our organization is committed to developing programs and advocating for polices that make it easier for everyone to get more physically active regardless of where they live\u201d said Ivor Benjamin M.D. American Heart Association president. \u201cIn 2008 the American Heart Association adopted the Physical Activity Guidelines and again we are proud to lead the call for health groups across the country to view these guidelines as beneficial to both public health and a worthy tool for clinicians.\u201d</p> <p>Notable updates:</p> <p>For more information about the latest Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans visit <a data-vars-outbound-link=""http://www.health.gov/paguidelines"" href=""http://www.health.gov/paguidelines"">www.health.gov/paguidelines</a>.</p> <p>Enter your email:</p> <p>Receive latest updates</p> <p><a href=""/rss/news.xml""><img alt=""Subscribe to our RSS"" class=""rss-updates"" src=""/sites/all/themes/project_h/css/images/rss-button.png""/></a></p> <p><a href=""/about/news/contacts/index.html#media-info"">HHS Media Information</a><br/><a href=""/about/news/contacts/index.html#aspa-press-contact"">ASPA Press Contacts</a><br/><a href=""/about/news/contacts/index.html#agency-press-contact"">HHS Agency Press Contacts</a></p> <p><strong><a class=""view-all"" href=""/about/news/contacts/index.html"">View all</a></strong></p> <p>\n<a addthis:userid=""HHS"" alt=""Visit the HHS Facebook account"" class=""addthis_button_facebook_follow"" target=""_parent"" title=""Visit the HHS Facebook account""><img alt=""Visit the HHS Facebook account"" src=""/sites/all/themes/project_h/css/images/facebook-icon-32x32.png""/></a>\n<a href=""https://twitter.com/hhsgov"" target=""_parent"" title=""Visit the HHS Twitter account""><img alt=""Visit the HHS Twitter account"" src=""/sites/all/themes/project_h/css/images/twitter-icon-32x32.png""/></a>\n<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/hhsgov/"" target=""_parent"" title=""Visit the HHS Instagram account""><img alt=""Visit the HHS Instagram account"" src=""/sites/all/themes/project_h/css/images/instagram-icon-32x32.png""/></a>\n</p> <p>\n<a addthis:userid=""USGOVHHS"" alt=""Visit the HHS YouTube account"" class=""addthis_button_youtube_follow"" target=""_parent"" title=""Visit the HHS YouTube account""><img alt=""Visit the HHS YouTube account"" src=""/sites/all/themes/project_h/css/images/youtube-icon-32x32.png""/></a>\n<a addthis:userid=""hhsgov/"" alt=""Visit the HHS Flickr account"" class=""addthis_button_flickr_follow"" target=""_parent"" title=""Visit the HHS Flickr account""><img alt=""Visit the HHS Flickr account"" src=""/sites/all/themes/project_h/css/images/flickr-icon-32x32.png""/></a>\n<a addthis:userid=""us-department-of-health-and-human-services/"" addthis:usertype=""company"" alt=""Visit the HHS LinkedIn account"" class=""addthis_button_linkedin_follow"" target=""_parent"" title=""Visit the HHS LinkedIn account""><img alt=""Visit the HHS LinkedIn account"" src=""/sites/all/themes/project_h/css/images/linkedin-icon-32x32.png""/></a>\n<!-- <a class=""addthis_button_pinterest_follow"" addthis:userid=""hhsgov/"" title=""Visit the HHS Pinterest account"" alt=""Visit the HHS Pinterest account"" target=""_parent""><img src=""/sites/all/themes/project_h/css/images/footer-pinterest.png"" alt=""Visit the HHS Pinterest account"" /></a> -->\n<!-- <a href=""https://plus.google.com/+HHS/posts"" title=""Visit HHS GooglePlus account"" target=""_parent""><img src=""/sites/all/themes/project_h/css/images/footer-googleplus.png"" alt=""Visit HHS GooglePlus account"" /></a> -->\n</p> <p>To sign up for updates or to access your subscriber preferences please enter your contact information below.</p> <p>U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services<br/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t200 Independence Avenue S.W.<br/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWashington D.C. 20201<br/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tToll Free Call Center: 1-877-696-6775\u200b</p>]",[Home &gt; About &gt; News &gt; HHS Releases Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans 2nd edition (Chicago) \u2013 Today Adm.

The updated guidelines include evidence-based strategies that leaders across the nation can use to help Americans fit more physical activity into their daily lives.\u201d The second edition based on a comprehensive scientific review reflects new knowledge about immediate and long-term health benefits from physical activity as well as new evidence that physical activity can help manage chronic conditions that many Americans have.\xa0\xa0 \u201cThe American Heart Association has long recognized physical activity as a proven way to lower chances of heart disease and live a longer healthier life. Our organization is committed to developing programs and advocating for polices that make it easier for everyone to get more physically active regardless of where they live\u201d said Ivor Benjamin M.D. American Heart Association president. \u201cIn 2008 the American Heart Association adopted the Physical Activity Guidelines and again we are proud to lead the call for health groups across the country to view these guidelines as beneficial to both public health and a worthy tool for clinicians.\u201d Notable updates: For more information about the latest Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans visit www.health.gov/paguidelines.

RAIN Live Oak created a software toolkit enabling health information systems of any size to integrate provenance into their data-flow without disrupting existing practices or data repository requirements. \u201cEnsuring provenance of data is an important step in achieving interoperability of health information\u201d said Don Rucker MD national coordinator for health information technology. \u201cWe look forward to seeing these winning submissions being implemented in electronic products that will allow for the secure trustworthy and reliable exchange of health information.\u201d Provenance is important in healthcare because it helps a person or entity receiving data be confident in its authenticity trustworthiness and reliability. The winners of Phase 2 of the challenge submitted a recorded demonstration solution guide and lessons learned focused on prototyping and testing the effectiveness of their solution. The need for health data provenance and standard approaches to capture it is an important priority across the health information technology system. It is complex and plays a role in almost everything related to the use and exchange of electronic data. The winning submissions demonstrated innovative and standardized solutions that could lead to improvements in the provenance of health data and will help the healthcare industry better maximize health data that is already digitized and ready to share.

Later in the week Secretary Azar will travel to Argentina for the G20 Health Ministerial Meeting.</p> <p>Today Secretary Azar began his meetings in Fortaleza Brazil. First he visited the Urgent Care Center Praia do Futuro where he learned about the structure of 24-hour urgent care units and how such centers function as a part of Brazil\u2019s decentralized public health system. Here he also saw first-hand how Fortaleza has used its decentralized model to manage patient flows for greater efficiency and improved outcomes.</p> <p>Next Secretary Azar attended a breakfast meeting with Cear\xe1 State Governor Camilo Santana Cear\xe1 State Health Secretary Henrique Javi and other key health officials to discuss the unique aspects of the healthcare system in the State of Cear\xe1 and how they have implemented innovative ways to increase access and improve outcomes. They also discussed the United States-Brazil collaboration on the Zika virus and how our two nations can work together to enhance and protect our citizens against global health threats.</p> <p>Later in the morning Secretary Azar met with Dr. Islane Ver\xe7osa of CAVIVER and her medical team. CAVIVER is a non-governmental organization (NGO) in Brazil that engages with the public health system and international partners. Secretary Azar and Dr. Ver\xe7osa discussed the partnership between the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Brazilian Ministry of Health on the CDC\u2019s <a data-vars-outbound-link=""https://www.cdc.gov/pregnancy/zika/research/zodiac.html"" href=""https://www.cdc.gov/pregnancy/zika/research/zodiac.html"">Zika Outcomes and Development in Infants and Children (ZODIAC)</a> investigation and how the results of this study have informed the care of children impacted by Zika. This follow-up assessment of children aged 12-24 months conceived during the 2015-2016 Zika virus outbreak in Brazil provided a first-ever description of the longer-term health and developmental effects of congenital Zika virus infection in children with microcephaly. At CAVIVER Secretary Azar met and spoke with children and families affected by congenital Zika syndrome.</p> <p>In the afternoon Secretary Azar met with additional children and families affected by congenital Zika syndrome at the Albert Sabin Infant Hospital. This hospital serves as a specialty care center in the Brazilian public health system and as a reference center for care of infants and children in the northeastern region of Brazil. Here Secretary Azar learned about the hospital\u2019s partnership with CDC on Zika and about the services they provide to care for children affected by the range of problems caused by microcephaly including hearing and vision problems and other neurological conditions.</p> <p>Secretary Azar reaffirmed HHS\u2019 and the CDC\u2019s continued support for Zika activities and reiterated that the Zika story is not over for affected families who face \xa0managing lifelong disabilities for affected children.\xa0 CDC continues to monitor the health outcomes and care of affected babies to learn how to best protect mothers and babies from Zika virus infection and other emerging threats.

Here he also saw first-hand how Fortaleza has used its decentralized model to manage patient flows for greater efficiency and improved outcomes. Next Secretary Azar attended a breakfast meeting with Cear\xe1 State Governor Camilo Santana Cear\xe1 State Health Secretary Henrique Javi and other key health officials to discuss the unique aspects of the healthcare system in the State of Cear\xe1 and how they have implemented innovative ways to increase access and improve outcomes.

Secretary Azar and Dr. Ver\xe7osa discussed the partnership between the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Brazilian Ministry of Health on the CDC\u2019s Zika Outcomes and Development in Infants and Children (ZODIAC) investigation and how the results of this study have informed the care of children impacted by Zika. This follow-up assessment of children aged 12-24 months conceived during the 2015-2016 Zika virus outbreak in Brazil provided a first-ever description of the longer-term health and developmental effects of congenital Zika virus infection in children with microcephaly.

The gathering follows President Trump\u2019s Monday announcement in New Hampshire of the administration\u2019s new opioid addiction initiative as well as travel and meetings by top HHS officials in seven states this week. Participants discussed ways in which their states have developed and enhanced PDMPs including efforts to make programs interoperable between states raise rates of provider and prescriber participation and make the best use possible of data generated. A number of participants individually shared the importance of combating stigma surrounding addiction an issue Secretary Azar has made a priority. Secretary Azar noted that PDMPs are an important part of ensuring the appropriate prescribing and use of legal opioids a key piece of the three-point administration opioids strategy unveiled on Monday which covers addiction prevention supply interdiction and treatment provision. The strategy proposes a nationally interoperable PDMP network building on work HHS already does to promote and support PDMPs including through CDC\u2019s Prevention For States grant program. Secretary Azar thanked the participants for their valuable insights and tireless work in confronting the challenge of opioid addiction. He emphasized President Trump\u2019s personal commitment to taking bold action against the crisis and emphasized that the federal government will continue to engage with state officials and support their work.

and resources allow the following practices to help make sure all segments of the community are served:</p> <p>Being mindful of all segments of the community and taking reasonable steps to provide an equal opportunity to benefit from emergency response efforts will help ensure that the disaster management in all areas affected by Hurricane Florence is successful.</p> <p>In addition as part of his declaration of a Public Health Emergency (PHE) HHS Secretary Alex Azar has waived sanctions and penalties under certain provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy Rule that may otherwise apply to covered hospitals including provisions that generally require covered entities to give patients the opportunity to agree or object to sharing information with family members or friends involved in the patient\u2019s care.\xa0 This waiver applies only to the emergency area and for the emergency period identified in the PHE declaration and only to hospitals that have instituted a disaster protocol.\xa0 Qualifying hospitals can take advantage of the waiver for up to 72 hours from the time the hospital implements its disaster protocol unless the PHE declaration terminates first.</p> <p>Even without a waiver the Privacy Rule allows patient information to be shared to assist in disaster relief efforts and to assist patients in receiving the care they need. \xa0As explained in more detail in OCR\u2019s Bulletin on Hurricane Florence and HIPAA linked below the Privacy Rule permits covered entities to share information for treatment purposes public health activities and to prevent or lessen a serious and imminent threat to health or safety. \xa0The Privacy Rule also allows the sharing of information with individuals\u2019 family friends

The BPA with an estimated value of $207 million provides end-to-end lifecycle support for all current and future HHS production systems regardless of manufacturer or operating system. It covers major HHS information technology operational needs such as network and security operations; data center operations; and deployment testing and maintenance of software and systems.

This funding through the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) supports a comprehensive system of HIV primary medical care medication and essential support services to more than half a million people living with HIV in the United States. \u201cNew medical advances and broader access to treatment have helped transform HIV/AIDS from a likely death sentence into a manageable chronic disease\u201d said HHS Secretary Alex Azar. \u201cThe Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program is an important way to ensure that these life-saving treatments reach the Americans who need them and the Trump Administration is committed to continuing to improve the care by Americans living with HIV/AIDS receive.\u201d ""The Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program plays a vital role in the United States' public health response to ending the HIV epidemic\u201d said HRSA Administrator George Sigounas M.S. Ph.D. ""These grants will help ensure that the most vulnerable Americans living with HIV/AIDS have access to life-saving care and treatment needed to improve their health quality and medical outcomes."" HRSA oversees the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program which is a patient-centered system that provides care and treatment services to low income people living with HIV to improve health outcomes and reduce HIV transmission among hard to reach populations. The program serves approximately 50 percent of people living with diagnosed HIV infection in the United States. In 2016 approximately 85 percent of Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program clients who received HIV medical care were virally suppressed up from 69 percent in 2010. ""The Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program is critical to improving clinical and public health outcomes by reducing HIV transmission and serves as an important source of ongoing access to HIV treatment and antiretroviral medication"" said Laura Cheever M.D. Sc.M. Associate Administrator HIV/AIDS Bureau. ""Today people living with HIV who take HIV medication daily as prescribed and who achieve and maintain an undetectable viral load have effectively no risk of sexually transmitting the virus to an HIV-negative partner.\u201d Under Part A of the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program approximately $624.3 million was awarded to 52 metropolitan areas to provide core medical and support services for people living with HIV. These grants were awarded to 24 eligible metropolitan areas and 28 transitional grant areas with the highest number of people living with HIV and AIDS and experiencing increases in HIV and AIDS cases and emerging care needs.

Other topics discussed by individual leaders included: President Trump\u2019s American Patients First drug pricing blueprint including HHS\u2019s announcement this week of new tools for Medicare plans to negotiate with drug companies; the possibilities presented by telemedicine; the important role played by federally qualified health centers; innovations to help patients access their own healthcare data; and the future of Accountable Care Organizations. Secretary Azar and Mr. Boehler stressed the department\u2019s commitment to reforming regulations that could be impeding value-based coordinated care and President Trump\u2019s commitment to ensuring all Americans have access to better healthcare at a lower cost.

The awards support HHS's Five-Point Opioid Strategy which was launched last year and enhanced this week. New data unveiled recently by HHS suggests that efforts are now yielding progress at the national level. ""Addressing the opioid crisis with all the resources possible and the best science we have is a top priority for President Trump and for everyone at HHS"" said Secretary Alex Azar. ""The more than $1 billion in additional funding that we provided this week will build on progress we have seen in tackling this epidemic through empowering communities and families on the frontlines."" ""This week HHS updated its strategic framework for tackling the opioid crisis which uses science as a foundation for our comprehensive strategy"" said Admiral Brett Giroir Assistant Secretary for Health and Senior Advisor for Opioid Policy. ""With these new funds states tribes and communities across America will be able to advance our strategy and continue making progress against this crisis.""  The 2017 National Survey on Drug Use and Health conducted by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) found that the number of Americans initiating heroin use dropped by around half from 2016 to 2017. The number of Americans misusing opioids also dropped for the second year in a row and the number receiving specialty treatment for heroin use increased. From January 2017 through August 2018 the amount of opioids prescribed in America has dropped by 21 percent. In the same time the number of prescriptions filled for naloxone has increased 264 percent while the number of prescriptions for buprenorphine one form of medication-assisted treatment has risen 16 percent (data from IQVIA's Total Patient Tracker). The Trump Administration will continue working to make progress against the opioid crisis which in 2017 claimed more than 130 lives per day. This week's major grant announcements most of them made possible by funding secured from Congress by President Trump in March 2018 are as follows:\n\t\xa0 Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration SAMHSA awarded more than $930 million in State Opioid Response grants to support a comprehensive response to the opioid epidemic and expand access to treatment and recovery support services. The grants aim to address the opioid crisis by increasing access to medication-assisted treatment using the three Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved medications for the treatment of opioid use disorder reducing unmet treatment need and reducing opioid overdose related deaths through the provision of prevention treatment and recovery activities for opioid use disorder. States received funding based on a formula with a 15 percent set-aside for the ten states with the highest mortality rate related to drug overdose deaths. Other funding provided through this program including $50 million for tribal communities will be awarded separately. In addition SAMHSA also awarded about $90 million to other programming for states and communities to expand access to medication-assisted treatment increase distribution and use of overdose reversal drugs and increase workforce development activities. Individual grantees\u2019 awards are listed at https://www.samhsa.gov/grants/awards/TI-18-015. To learn more about SAMHSA-supported resources please visit SAMHSA's Prescription Drug Misuse and Abuse page. \xa0 Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) HRSA awarded over $396 million to combat the opioid crisis. The investments will enable HRSA-funded community health centers academic institutions and rural organizations to expand access to integrated substance use disorder and mental health services. To learn about HRSA-supported resources please visit HRSA's Opioid Crisis page.\n\t\xa0 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) The CDC awarded $155.5 million to increase support for states and territories working to prevent opioid-related overdoses deaths and other outcomes. This funding will advance the understanding of the opioid overdose epidemic and scale-up prevention and response activities including improving the timeliness and quality of surveillance data. In addition CDC awarded $12 million in funds to support 11 Tribal Epidemiology Centers and 15 tribal entities. These funds will improve opioid overdose surveillance so that prevention strategies can be targeted to better address this threat to tribal communities. CDC is also distributing an additional $27 million to nine non-governmental organizations which will support states and territories with staffing procurement and training to enhance local public health capacity.

This decision does not require that HHS make any changes to any of the ACA programs it administers or its enforcement of any portion of the ACA at this time. As always the Trump Administration stands ready to work with Congress on policy solutions that will deliver more insurance choices better healthcare and lower costs while continuing to protect individuals with pre-existing conditions.\u201d \xa0 Enter your email: Receive latest updates  HHS Media InformationASPA Press ContactsHHS Agency Press Contacts View all \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n To sign up for updates or to access your subscriber preferences please enter your contact information below.

Azar today declared public health emergencies in the two states as Hurricane Florence continues its track toward the eastern seaboard. The declarations give HHS\u2019 Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services\u2019 (CMS) beneficiaries and their healthcare providers and suppliers greater flexibility in meeting emergency health needs. \u201cHurricane Florence is an intense storm and is predicted to be highly destructive which poses a significant threat to the health and safety of those in its path\u201d Secretary Azar said. \u201cThese actions help ensure that Americans who rely on Medicare and Medicaid have continuous access to the care they need when the storm makes landfall.\u201d In addition to making these declarations to increase the flexibility in providing services to and assistance for CMS beneficiaries HHS strategically pre-positioned approximately 230 medical personnel from the National Disaster Medical System and their caches of medical equipment in North Carolina and Maryland so these assets are available quickly to help state and local authorities respond to communities\u2019 medical needs. HHS also activated the U.S. Public Health Commissioned Corps\u2019 Rapid Deployment Force to assist if needed after the storm. Additional staff is on standby to assist. HHS staff from the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) also coordinated with the Federal Emergency Management Agency to activate a national contract that makes additional ambulances available to evacuate hospitals and nursing homes if needed. ASPR regional emergency coordinators are staffing operations centers in impacted states to stay abreast of potential public health and medical needs post-storm. ASPR and CMS also coordinated to provide information to North Carolina and South Carolina health officials on the number of Medicare beneficiaries who rely on dialysis or on special medical equipment at home and the type of equipment such as oxygen concentrators in the potentially impacted areas. With this information health and emergency management agencies can respond better particularly after power outages to save lives. Secretary Azar acted under his authority in the Public Health Service Act and Social Security Act in declaring the public health emergency and authorizing flexibilities for CMS beneficiaries. These actions and flexibilities are retroactive to September 7 2018 in North Carolina and to September 8 2018 in South Carolina.

Based on the characteristics the test identifies the class of bacteria and which antibiotics are best for treating that particular bacterial infection.</p> <p>Faster information to select the best antibiotic can speed a patient\u2019s recovery which means fewer days spent in a hospital and better outcomes for patients. The ability to match bacteria more precisely to the drugs that will combat the infection also could curb <a data-vars-outbound-link=""https://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/"" href=""https://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/"">antibiotic resistant infections</a>.</p> <p>\u201cAntibiotic resistance is a growing threat to public health and to the health security of the United States\u201d said BARDA Director Rick Bright Ph.D. \u201cIn a bioterrorism incident antibiotic resistant infections could be devastating. We will need innovative tools for precision medicine to save lives.\u201d</p> <p>BARDA is sponsoring the development of two test systems from SeLux.\xa0 The company\u2019s first-generation test system may be able to provide results using bacteria isolated from patient samples 24 hours faster than current state-of-the-art methods and may be able to provide results from blood samples three days faster than the current methods. The company\u2019s second-generation test system may be able to provide results the same day that the test is started.</p> <p>The tests are designed to be used in hospital and commercial laboratories. Rapid information on bacteria and how susceptible they are to antibiotics would help doctors make earlier better-informed decisions about how best to treat infections.</p> <p>BARDA funding will support necessary work for the company to apply for U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval. The agreement can be extended to fund additional work up to a total of approximately $36 million through 2023.</p> <p>In addition to SeLux\u2019s diagnostic test systems BARDA is supporting development of other antibiotic susceptibility tests that can distinguish between bacterial and viral infections. BARDA also is working with federal partners to develop other tests that identify bacterial infections and the bacteria\u2019s susceptibility to specific antibiotics. These efforts are part of the HHS commitment to combat antimicrobial resistance and to support antibiotic stewardship.

The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) part of ASPR will sponsor the advanced development of the new testing technology under an 18-month approximately $9.3 million contract with SeLux Diagnostic Inc of Charlestown Massachusetts. SeLux is developing a phenotypic test; it identifies bacteria based on observable physical or biochemical characteristics of the bacteria. Based on the characteristics the test identifies the class of bacteria and which antibiotics are best for treating that particular bacterial infection. Faster information to select the best antibiotic can speed a patient\u2019s recovery which means fewer days spent in a hospital and better outcomes for patients. The ability to match bacteria more precisely to the drugs that will combat the infection also could curb antibiotic resistant infections. \u201cAntibiotic resistance is a growing threat to public health and to the health security of the United States\u201d said BARDA Director Rick Bright Ph.D. \u201cIn a bioterrorism incident antibiotic resistant infections could be devastating. We will need innovative tools for precision medicine to save lives.\u201d BARDA is sponsoring the development of two test systems from SeLux.\xa0 The company\u2019s first-generation test system may be able to provide results using bacteria isolated from patient samples 24 hours faster than current state-of-the-art methods and may be able to provide results from blood samples three days faster than the current methods. The company\u2019s second-generation test system may be able to provide results the same day that the test is started. The tests are designed to be used in hospital and commercial laboratories. Rapid information on bacteria and how susceptible they are to antibiotics would help doctors make earlier better-informed decisions about how best to treat infections. BARDA funding will support necessary work for the company to apply for U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval. The agreement can be extended to fund additional work up to a total of approximately $36 million through 2023. In addition to SeLux\u2019s diagnostic test systems BARDA is supporting development of other antibiotic susceptibility tests that can distinguish between bacterial and viral infections. BARDA also is working with federal partners to develop other tests that identify bacterial infections and the bacteria\u2019s susceptibility to specific antibiotics. These efforts are part of the HHS commitment to combat antimicrobial resistance and to support antibiotic stewardship. To encourage antimicrobial stewardship further ASPR provides hospitals and health care coalitions with guidance and the latest information on antibiotic resistant infections and new tools to combat them.

First he visited the Municipal Infant Hospital <em>\u201cMenino Jesus\u201d </em>and met with hospital leadership. They discussed the shared challenges U.S. and Brazilian hospitals face in improving quality and implementing efficient service models to integrate principles of value-based care. At the hospital Secretary Azar visited the outpatient ward as well as the newly opened transplantation ward which is an example of their successful public-private partnership with the Syrian-Lebanese Hospital.</p> <p>Next he visited the Syrian-Lebanese Hospital with the Brazilian Minister of Health Gilberto Occhi other government officials and hospital leadership. Here Secretary Azar learned about efforts they are making on quality metrics and how principles of value-based care might have a positive impact on controlling costs and improving outcomes at the hospital. He saw their state-of-the-art robotic training facilities and simulation training center which is available to all the clinicians affiliated with Syrian-Lebanese including those at their public hospital partners. He finished his tour with a conversation with members of the board of directors who are descendants of the women who originally founded the hospital.</p> <p>In the afternoon Secretary Azar and Minister Occhi visited the Butantan Institute with Marco Antonio Zago the S\xe3o Paulo State Secretary of Health. They were hosted by Dimas Tadeu Covas the Director of the Butantan Institute and Rui Curi the Deputy Director of the Butantan Institute. The Butantan Institute is a semi-autonomous biomedical research and production facility and is the main producer of immunobiological products in Brazil. At the Institute Secretary Azar saw the \u201cmilking\u201d of a snake for anti-venom and the newly expanded influenza vaccination manufacturing facility. The Butantan Institute has longstanding collaborations with HHS\u2019 National Institutes of Health (NIH) and HHS\u2019 Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA).</p> <p>While at the Butantan Institute Secretary Azar and Minister Occhi discussed the U.S.-Brazil long-standing cooperation in health research including biotech and vaccine production. HHS\u2019 collaborative work with Brazil has successfully resulted in a number of new treatments moving all the way to the manufacturing stage. At the Institute Secretary Azar discussed the latest updates on the tetravalent dengue vaccine that was developed in collaboration with NIH. The candidate vaccine has completed Phase 1 and 2 trials in the United States Brazil Bangladesh and Thailand. As a result of the technology transfer from NIH the ongoing Phase 3 clinic trial in Brazil and the completion of a state-of-the-art manufacturing plant the Butantan Institute is now well positioned to produce the vaccine and make it available for large-scale immunization initiatives in Brazil.</p> <p>Next Secretary Azar visited the S\xe3o Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP).

First he visited the Municipal Infant Hospital \u201cMenino Jesus\u201d and met with hospital leadership. They discussed the shared challenges U.S. and Brazilian hospitals face in improving quality and implementing efficient service models to integrate principles of value-based care. At the hospital Secretary Azar visited the outpatient ward as well as the newly opened transplantation ward which is an example of their successful public-private partnership with the Syrian-Lebanese Hospital. Next he visited the Syrian-Lebanese Hospital with the Brazilian Minister of Health Gilberto Occhi other government officials and hospital leadership. Here Secretary Azar learned about efforts they are making on quality metrics and how principles of value-based care might have a positive impact on controlling costs and improving outcomes at the hospital. He saw their state-of-the-art robotic training facilities and simulation training center which is available to all the clinicians affiliated with Syrian-Lebanese including those at their public hospital partners. He finished his tour with a conversation with members of the board of directors who are descendants of the women who originally founded the hospital. In the afternoon Secretary Azar and Minister Occhi visited the Butantan Institute with Marco Antonio Zago the S\xe3o Paulo State Secretary of Health. They were hosted by Dimas Tadeu Covas the Director of the Butantan Institute and Rui Curi the Deputy Director of the Butantan Institute. The Butantan Institute is a semi-autonomous biomedical research and production facility and is the main producer of immunobiological products in Brazil. At the Institute Secretary Azar saw the \u201cmilking\u201d of a snake for anti-venom and the newly expanded influenza vaccination manufacturing facility. The Butantan Institute has longstanding collaborations with HHS\u2019 National Institutes of Health (NIH) and HHS\u2019 Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA). While at the Butantan Institute Secretary Azar and Minister Occhi discussed the U.S.-Brazil long-standing cooperation in health research including biotech and vaccine production. HHS\u2019 collaborative work with Brazil has successfully resulted in a number of new treatments moving all the way to the manufacturing stage. At the Institute Secretary Azar discussed the latest updates on the tetravalent dengue vaccine that was developed in collaboration with NIH. The candidate vaccine has completed Phase 1 and 2 trials in the United States Brazil Bangladesh and Thailand. As a result of the technology transfer from NIH the ongoing Phase 3 clinic trial in Brazil and the completion of a state-of-the-art manufacturing plant the Butantan Institute is now well positioned to produce the vaccine and make it available for large-scale immunization initiatives in Brazil. Next Secretary Azar visited the S\xe3o Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP). He participated in a meeting with senior leadership where he highlighted the extensive history of U.S. scientific cooperation with FAPESP and the larger Brazilian scientific community. Then he delivered a speech to an audience composed of members of S\xe3o Paulo\u2019s scientific and innovation community in which he discussed his priorities to spur the innovation economy in the United States including leveraging research collaborations and utilizing public-private partnerships. In the evening Secretary Azar participated in a dinner and roundtable meeting with the American Chamber of Commerce in S\xe3o Paulo. The meeting focused on private sector innovations in Brazil to spur value-based transformation in the health system. Additional information regarding the Secretary\u2019s meetings and schedule will be forthcoming in news releases and social media posts.\xa0 To view his remarks online please visit:https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/secretary/speeches/2018-speeches/remarks-at-fapesp-on-biomedical-research-and-innovation.html Enter your email: Receive latest updates  HHS Media InformationASPA Press ContactsHHS Agency Press Contacts View all \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n To sign up for updates or to access your subscriber preferences please enter your contact information below.

The declaration gives the HHS Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services beneficiaries and their healthcare providers and suppliers greater flexibility in meeting emergency health needs.</p> <p>\u201cHurricane Michael poses a significant threat to the health and safety of those in its path\u201d Secretary Azar said. \u201cThese actions help ensure that our fellow Americans who rely on Medicare and Medicaid have continuous access to the care they need.\u201d</p> <p>HHS also staged approximately 125 personnel from the <a data-vars-outbound-link=""https://www.phe.gov/Preparedness/responders/ndms/Pages/default.aspx"" href=""https://www.phe.gov/Preparedness/responders/ndms/Pages/default.aspx"">National Disaster Medical System</a> and an Incident Management Team along with caches of medical equipment in Mobile Alabama and Jacksonville Florida so these assets are available quickly to help state and local authorities respond to communities\u2019 medical needs. HHS placed about 100 additional personnel on alert from the National Disaster Medical System and the U.S. Public Health Commissioned Corps to assist if needed after the storm.</p> <p>In addition the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) and CMS coordinated to provide information to Florida health officials on the number of Medicare beneficiaries who rely on dialysis or use special medical equipment at home and the type of equipment such as oxygen concentrators in the potentially impacted areas. With this information health and emergency management agencies can respond better particularly after power outages to save lives.</p> <p>CMS also activated the Kidney Community Emergency Response Program to monitor dialysis access and needs of these facilities after the hurricane makes landfall. Through a CMS contract this program provides technical assistance to End Stage Renal Disease Networks kidney organizations and other groups to ensure timely and efficient disaster preparedness response and recovery for the kidney community.</p> <p>To assist residents in the impacted area in coping with the stress of the disasters the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration activated the Disaster Distress Helpline. The helpline provides immediate 24/7 365-days-a-year crisis counseling and support to people experiencing emotional distress related to natural or human-caused disasters. This toll-free multilingual and confidential crisis support service is available to all residents in the United States and its territories.

The declaration gives the HHS Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services beneficiaries and their healthcare providers and suppliers greater flexibility in meeting emergency health needs. \u201cHurricane Michael poses a significant threat to the health and safety of those in its path\u201d Secretary Azar said. \u201cThese actions help ensure that our fellow Americans who rely on Medicare and Medicaid have continuous access to the care they need.\u201d HHS also staged approximately 125 personnel from the National Disaster Medical System and an Incident Management Team along with caches of medical equipment in Mobile Alabama and Jacksonville Florida so these assets are available quickly to help state and local authorities respond to communities\u2019 medical needs. HHS placed about 100 additional personnel on alert from the National Disaster Medical System and the U.S. Public Health Commissioned Corps to assist if needed after the storm. In addition the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) and CMS coordinated to provide information to Florida health officials on the number of Medicare beneficiaries who rely on dialysis or use special medical equipment at home and the type of equipment such as oxygen concentrators in the potentially impacted areas. With this information health and emergency management agencies can respond better particularly after power outages to save lives. CMS also activated the Kidney Community Emergency Response Program to monitor dialysis access and needs of these facilities after the hurricane makes landfall. Through a CMS contract this program provides technical assistance to End Stage Renal Disease Networks kidney organizations and other groups to ensure timely and efficient disaster preparedness response and recovery for the kidney community. To assist residents in the impacted area in coping with the stress of the disasters the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration activated the Disaster Distress Helpline. The helpline provides immediate 24/7 365-days-a-year crisis counseling and support to people experiencing emotional distress related to natural or human-caused disasters. This toll-free multilingual and confidential crisis support service is available to all residents in the United States and its territories. Stress anxiety and other depression-like symptoms are common reactions after a disaster.

Adams M.D. M.P.H. urged more Americans to carry a lifesaving medication that can reverse the effects of an opioid overdose.</a></p> <p>The medication naloxone is already carried by many first responders such as EMTs and police officers. The Surgeon General is now recommending that more individuals including family friends and those who are personally at risk for an opioid overdose also keep the drug on hand.</p> <p>An estimated 2.1 million people in the U.S. struggle with an opioid use disorder. Rates of opioid overdose deaths are rapidly increasing.

Adams M.D. M.P.H. urged more Americans to carry a lifesaving medication that can reverse the effects of an opioid overdose. The medication naloxone is already carried by many first responders such as EMTs and police officers. The Surgeon General is now recommending that more individuals including family friends and those who are personally at risk for an opioid overdose also keep the drug on hand. An estimated 2.1 million people in the U.S. struggle with an opioid use disorder. Rates of opioid overdose deaths are rapidly increasing. Since 2010 the number of opioid overdose deaths has doubled from more than 21000 to more than 42000 in 2016 with the sharpest increase occurring among deaths related to illicitly made fentanyl and fentanyl analogs (synthetic opioids). Opioids are a class of drugs that include medications such as oxycodone hydrocodone and methadone which are commonly prescribed to treat pain. Pharmaceutical fentanyl is a synthetic opioid which is 50 times more potent than heroin and 100 times more potent than morphine. It is approved for treating severe pain typically post-surgical or advanced cancer pain. However most recent cases of fentanyl-related harms are a result of illicitly made fentanyl. \u201cEach day we lose 115 Americans to an opioid overdose \u2013 that\u2019s one person every 12.5 minutes\u201d said Surgeon General Adams. \u201cIt is time to make sure more people have access to this lifesaving medication because 77 percent of opioid overdose deaths occur outside of a medical setting and more than half occur at home.\u201d Naloxone an FDA-approved medication that can be delivered via nasal mist or injection is not a long-term solution but it can temporarily suspend the effects of the overdose until emergency responders arrive. \u201cTo manage opioid addiction and prevent future overdoses increased naloxone availability must occur in conjunction with expanded access to evidence-based treatment for opioid use disorder\u201d the Surgeon General said. All states have passed laws to increase access to naloxone and in most states you can walk into a pharmacy and request naloxone even if you don\u2019t already have a prescription. In addition most states have laws designed to protect health care professionals for prescribing and dispensing naloxone from civil and criminal liabilities as well as Good Samaritan laws to protect people who administer naloxone or call for help during an opioid overdose emergency. Naloxone is covered by most insurance plans and for those without coverage may be available at low or no cost through local public health programs or through retailer and manufacturer discounts. It is easy to use safe to administer and widely available. Today\u2019s Surgeon General advisory on naloxone is part of the administration\u2019s ongoing effort to respond to the sharp increase among drug overdose deaths.

Uncontrollable seizures are a devastating result of exposure to nerve agents and can be deadly or lead to permanent brain damage.</p> <p>\u201cNerve agents are the most toxic and rapidly acting of the known chemical warfare agents\u201d explained Rick Bright Ph.D. director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (<a data-vars-outbound-link=""https://www.phe.gov/barda"" href=""https://www.phe.gov/barda"">BARDA</a>) a component of ASPR. \u201cAlthough the Strategic National Stockpile includes anti-seizure medications those medications may not be completely effective in stopping all seizures. To save more lives and improve long-term health for survivors a second-line anti-seizure medication is needed.\u201d</p> <p>Under the 9-month approximately $3 million agreement announced today Proniras will develop Tezampanel as a treatment for seizures that have not been stopped by benzodiazepines a class of drugs that includes the stockpiled medication diazepam (better known as valium). The contract can be extended up to a total of approximately $89.5 million over five years.</p> <p>In clinical trials Tezampanel which works by a different mechanism than diazepam was shown to be safe. Recent studies also have shown Tezampanel to be an effective seizure treatment in rats with soman nerve agent poisoning even when the drug was given after a significant delay. <a data-vars-outbound-link=""https://emergency.cdc.gov/agent/soman/basics/facts.asp"" href=""https://emergency.cdc.gov/agent/soman/basics/facts.asp"">Soman</a> is an extremely toxic man-made chemical warfare agent originally developed as an insecticide in Germany in 1944.</p> <p>Under the BARDA contract Proniras will conduct studies to evaluate whether Tezampanel also stops seizures in rats even after benzodiazepine treatment has failed to do so. These studies may lead Proniras to apply for FDA approval of Tezampanel to treat seizures that do not respond to benzodiazepines including seizures resulting from nerve agent exposure. Proniras also will explore other potential commercial uses for the drug.</p> <p>Development of this new drug is part of ASPR\u2019s efforts to develop medical products procedures and capabilities to protect health and save lives in terrorist attacks including those using nerve agents. Nerve agents were used in an attack in the Tokyo subway in 1995 and in the Syrian civil war.</p> <p>BARDA\u2019s preparedness efforts include development of eight novel and repurposed therapeutics and PRISM the first evidence-based <a data-vars-outbound-link=""https://www.medicalcountermeasures.gov/barda/cbrn/prism/"" href=""https://www.medicalcountermeasures.gov/barda/cbrn/prism/"">decontamination procedures</a> for use after exposure to any of four classes of chemical agents.</p> <p>BARDA continues to seek proposals for the development of effective products to treat injuries caused by chemical agents including new products and new indications for products already in clinical use. The products must be easy to use in a mass casualty situation and safe and effective for all segments of the population.

Uncontrollable seizures are a devastating result of exposure to nerve agents and can be deadly or lead to permanent brain damage. \u201cNerve agents are the most toxic and rapidly acting of the known chemical warfare agents\u201d explained Rick Bright Ph.D. director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) a component of ASPR. \u201cAlthough the Strategic National Stockpile includes anti-seizure medications those medications may not be completely effective in stopping all seizures. To save more lives and improve long-term health for survivors a second-line anti-seizure medication is needed.\u201d Under the 9-month approximately $3 million agreement announced today Proniras will develop Tezampanel as a treatment for seizures that have not been stopped by benzodiazepines a class of drugs that includes the stockpiled medication diazepam (better known as valium). The contract can be extended up to a total of approximately $89.5 million over five years. In clinical trials Tezampanel which works by a different mechanism than diazepam was shown to be safe. Recent studies also have shown Tezampanel to be an effective seizure treatment in rats with soman nerve agent poisoning even when the drug was given after a significant delay. Soman is an extremely toxic man-made chemical warfare agent originally developed as an insecticide in Germany in 1944. Under the BARDA contract Proniras will conduct studies to evaluate whether Tezampanel also stops seizures in rats even after benzodiazepine treatment has failed to do so. These studies may lead Proniras to apply for FDA approval of Tezampanel to treat seizures that do not respond to benzodiazepines including seizures resulting from nerve agent exposure. Proniras also will explore other potential commercial uses for the drug. Development of this new drug is part of ASPR\u2019s efforts to develop medical products procedures and capabilities to protect health and save lives in terrorist attacks including those using nerve agents. Nerve agents were used in an attack in the Tokyo subway in 1995 and in the Syrian civil war. BARDA\u2019s preparedness efforts include development of eight novel and repurposed therapeutics and PRISM the first evidence-based decontamination procedures for use after exposure to any of four classes of chemical agents. BARDA continues to seek proposals for the development of effective products to treat injuries caused by chemical agents including new products and new indications for products already in clinical use. The products must be easy to use in a mass casualty situation and safe and effective for all segments of the population. Proposals are accepted through the Broad Agency Announcement BARDA- BAA-18-100-SOL-00003 at the Federal Business Opportunities website www.fbo.gov. The project announced today is part of BARDA\u2019s integrated portfolio for the advanced research and development innovation acquisition and manufacturing of medical countermeasures \u2013 vaccines drugs therapeutics diagnostic tools and non-pharmaceutical products for public health emergency threats. These threats include chemical biological radiological and nuclear agents pandemic influenza and emerging infectious diseases.

Communication During Emergencies The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office for Civil Rights (OCR) has unveiled a plain language checklist to help first responders provide services to individuals with limited English proficiency and individuals with disabilities during emergency response and recovery efforts.\xa0 According to the U.S. Census Bureau at least 350 languages are spoken across the country. \xa0In addition approximately 15 percent of adults report some trouble hearing 8.1 million people are visually impaired and 32 million adults are illiterate.\xa0 Federal civil rights laws including Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 mandate that federally funded emergency response and recovery services must be accessible to people with limited English proficiency and people with disabilities.\xa0 \u201cRecent natural disasters have demonstrated the importance of ensuring accessibility to health and human services for everyone living in the United States including people who are limited English proficient or with disabilities in need of interpretation and translation services\u201d said Director of the HHS Office for Civil Rights and Chair of the HHS Language Access Steering Committee Roger Severino. \u201cI commend our first responders for keeping Americans safe and hope that this tool will assist them and the diverse communities they serve in emergency situations.\u201d The checklist resulted from efforts of the HHS Language Access Steering Committee led by the HHS Office for Civil Rights.\xa0 It includes recommendations specific action steps and resources to assist first responders in providing on-the-ground language assistance and communicating effectively in disasters.\xa0 It complements an emergency preparedness checklist HHS released in 2016 and is an additional tool for responders and local partners who serve community members limited English proficiency or disabilities.\xa0 Practical tips range from how to identify language needs in a disaster-impacted community to effectively utilizing interpreters.\xa0 In a recent blog experts in the HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response and OCR explore how public health healthcare and emergency response organizations can use the new checklist to enhance language access and create disaster health communications to better assist impacted communities.\xa0 Visit the OCR website to view the checklist and read essential information on how federal civil rights laws and HIPAA laws apply in emergencies.
